=Episode 11=

3
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.130
It's done.

4
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.800
Your Ladyship,

5
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.320
you're so great.

6
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.360
Our shabby house

7
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.880
looks totally different

8
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.010
in just one day.

9
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.010
Of course.

10
00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.720
I'm Nie Sangyu, after all.

11
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.960
Okay.

12
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.800
Muxu,

13
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.210
you've been busy today,

14
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.080
so go back now.

15
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.290
Yes, Your Ladyship.

16
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.180
(Jiangzhen Pavilion)

17
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:02.530
How is it?

18
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.850
Your Lordship, I'm inefficient.

19
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.290
I couldn't find the mouse.

20
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.600
How could it be?

21
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.480
I saw

22
00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.570
it was there just now.

23
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.130
It couldn't run here, could it?

24
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.130
Gui Bai,

25
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.130
keep looking for it.

26
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.970
Yes.

27
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.200
Your Lordship,

28
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.250
it's said

29
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.250
mice are intelligential.

30
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.970
They can hear

31
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.160
our words,

32
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.600
so the mouse may be hiding somewhere

33
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.720
after hearing we wanted to catch it.

34
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.130
I think we can't find it

35
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.440
for the time being.

36
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.760
Forget it.

37
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.090
I'll sleep here tonight.

38
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.250
I can

39
00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.970
cover my head tonight

40
00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.920
in case it'll bite my face.

41
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.130
It's not a big deal.

42
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.600
Or

43
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.600
you can sleep in my room.

44
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.850
I'll sleep on the floor
while you can sleep on the bed.

45
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.930
But if you can't bear to see me
sleeping on the floor,

46
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.520
we can

47
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.840
have an exchange.

48
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.690
No.

49
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.610
Really?

50
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.490
Gui Bai, let's go.

51
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.200
How about I reward you
with a blue bead tomorrow?

52
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.690
Why?

53
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:02.400
It's because you're willing
to sleep on the floor

54
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.610
and let me sleep on the bed.

55
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.730
I'll ask Gui Bai

56
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.960
to catch the mouse tomorrow.

57
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.690
By then,

58
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.010
go back to sleep in your room.

59
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.170
Look at you.

60
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.050
You just arrived in Haifang,

61
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.280
but you've seen a coffin

62
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.320
and a mouse.

63
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.170
It's too pitiful.

64
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.440
How many people have you offended?

65
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.520
I'm not as powerful as you are.

66
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:37.960
Why am I powerful?

67
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.440
Do you mean when
I was in the Ning's Mansion?

68
00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.320
Yes.

69
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.370
I would have forgotten it
if you didn't mention.

70
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.130
Back then,

71
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.250
I was so good at ruling
the servants of the Ning's Mansion

72
00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.010
that they were very obedient to me.

73
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.400
How about

74
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.730
I go to the backyard

75
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.370
and bribe the servants tomorrow?

76
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.880
If it works,

77
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.050
give me two red beads.

78
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.690
What do you think?
It's not expensive, is it?

79
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.200
If you can really make it,

80
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:14.810
I can give you 100 red beads,

81
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.200
not to mention two.

82
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.840
How is it?

83
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.400
Really?

84
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.730
100 red beads?

85
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:22.520
Sleep.

86
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:24.570
Don't go back on your word.

87
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.570
(100 red beads.)

88
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.880
100 red beads.

89
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.280
Your Majesty,

90
00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:55.880
I heard

91
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:57.640
Prime Minister Liu was ill

92
00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.520
and didn't get better even if you sent

93
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:00.730
the imperial physician to treat him.

94
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.610
He couldn't go to court today,

95
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.760
and I know

96
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.320
it's because

97
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.570
he worries about

98
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:09.170
the court very much.

99
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.730
Prime Minister Liu
is a high-ranking official,

100
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.960
and he should rest well before
dealing with administrative affairs.

101
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:17.130
I venture

102
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.400
to beg you

103
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.280
to set up a job of
the acting prime minister

104
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:23.130
so that Mr. Liu could
recuperate securely.

105
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.690
Mr. Wang, who do you want to recommend?

106
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:26.440
Your Majesty,

107
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:27.810
this matter is important,

108
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.200
and only the one
with virtue and intelligence

109
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.400
could be qualified for it.

110
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:31.840
Left Consul

111
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.200
Mr. Ning

112
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:35.930
should have been suitable for it,

113
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.370
but he broke the law

114
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.520
and was sent to Haifang,

115
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.130
so I'm afraid he isn't
qualified for the job.

116
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.610
In my opinion,

117
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.200
we can let

118
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.250
Mr. Ling, the Right Consul,

119
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.400
to take this job.

120
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.250
Don't worry too much, Mr. Wang.

121
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.610
The imperial physician has told me

122
00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:58.570
that Prime Minister Liu...

123
00:07:58.570 --> 00:07:59.010
Mr. Cao.

124
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:00.640
...will get better in a few days,

125
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.200
so let's

126
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.640
put the matter of the
acting prime minister aside.

127
00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:09.810
Your Majesty, Lord Tan
is waiting outside the palace.

128
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:12.760
Let him in.

129
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.200
Please enter the palace, Lord Tan.

130
00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.130
I pay my respects to you, Your Majesty.

131
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.450
Lord Tan,

132
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.160
what's wrong?

133
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:51.880
Your Majesty,

134
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.210
I came for the matter
of the prime minister.

135
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.800
Mr. Liu is old

136
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.450
and has been ill for a long time,

137
00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:59.880
so he isn't suitable

138
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.730
for the job anymore.

139
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.450
As for the new prime minister,

140
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.760
I want to recommend someone.

141
00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:08.970
Who is it?

142
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.400
It's Consul Ling.

143
00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.280
Mr. Wang,

144
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.920
Minister of Justice,

145
00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.730
mentioned this thing just now,

146
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.850
and I didn't expect you
to mention it again.

147
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.040
It seems

148
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.040
you two connect with each other.

149
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.880
Your Majesty,

150
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.450
I've never discussed it with Mr. Wang,

151
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.400
but since he

152
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.730
has the same thought,

153
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:37.680
we could tell

154
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.970
it's the public will.

155
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.730
Lord Tan,

156
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.330
the job of the prime minister

157
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.680
matters to our nation,

158
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.880
so I have to

159
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:51.010
think about it carefully.

160
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.850
It allows no delay, Your Majesty.

161
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.760
How about

162
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.210
asking for other
officials' opinions, Your Majesty?

163
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.280
Your Majesty,

164
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.210
I think

165
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.920
choosing a new prime minister

166
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.280
allows no delay.

167
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:15.800
Your Majesty,

168
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:16.640
I also think

169
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.250
choosing a new prime minister

170
00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:19.370
allows no delay.

171
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:20.760
I agree.

172
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:21.490
I agree.

173
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.160
I agree.

174
00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:23.010
I agree.

175
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:23.920
I agree.

176
00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:24.880
I agree.

177
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:25.760
I agree.

178
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.250
I agree.

179
00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:28.680
I agree.

180
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.160
Since all of you agree that,

181
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.160
does it mean

182
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.250
my decision is

183
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.160
wrong?

184
00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.880
No.

185
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.210
Ling Jianxing,

186
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.800
what do you think?

187
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.680
It depends on you, Your Majesty.

188
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:06.610
Your Majesty.

189
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.010
Your Majesty, I disagree.

190
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:13.560
Your Majesty,

191
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.560
my master

192
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.010
is going to recover

193
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.400
in just a few days,

194
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:18.520
so we don't need to

195
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.210
choose a new prime minister

196
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.730
rashly,

197
00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.160
nor do we need to set up
the job of the acting prime minister.

198
00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:24.760
Besides,

199
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.040
I don't think Mr. Ling

200
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.970
is the most suitable person.

201
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:33.010
Then who do you want to recommend?

202
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:33.880
I want to recommend myself.

203
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.680
I hope to share your worries and burdens

204
00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:36.920
and contribute myself

205
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.040
to our nation and people.

206
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.400
I also want to recommend myself.

207
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:42.160
I want to be the prime minister, too.

208
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:43.610
I want to ease the burden for the nation.

209
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.920
Although I'm a military general,

210
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:46.850
I'm loyal to our nation.

211
00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.680
If no one takes the
job of the prime minister,

212
00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:51.130
I'm willing to take it

213
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.090
and relieve you of your worries,
Your Majesty.

214
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.010
How ridiculous.

215
00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:58.850
Your Majesty.

216
00:11:59.010 --> 00:11:59.730
Lord Tan,

217
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.010
the job of the prime minister

218
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.800
is indeed important,

219
00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:05.640
and many officials

220
00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.730
want to take this job,

221
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:09.010
so

222
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.330
I need to think about it
before making the decision.

223
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.520
Okay.

224
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.010
Let's end up now.

225
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.210
The court is done.

226
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.800
Long live Your Majesty.

227
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.640
Is there any other way?

228
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.520
Why don't I...

229
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:59.610
How is it?

230
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.490
The second-rank lady
with imperial mandate.

231
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:03.730
I've prepared

232
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:05.090
100 red beads.

233
00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:12.210
Why are people of Haifang

234
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:13.880
so stubborn?

235
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.730
Why do they refuse everything?

236
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.330
Has it ever occurred to you

237
00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.090
that it's not a money problem?

238
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:21.280
Then what is it?

239
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.130
What are you going to do?

240
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.130
Me?

241
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.490
I'm not like you

242
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.400
who only sits idle and eats.

243
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.090
I

244
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.330
will hang out later

245
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:38.850
to check things.

246
00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:39.880
After all,

247
00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:41.130
I was going to open a shop in the capital,

248
00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.280
but you ruined my plan.

249
00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:44.610
Since I'm in Haifang now,

250
00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.280
I'll still

251
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.370
open my

252
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:47.210
cosmetic shop.

253
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.280
Good.

254
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:50.880
I'll go with you.

255
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.640
No need.

256
00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:08.160
Can I?

257
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.640
Okay.

258
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:30.640
What are you thinking about?

259
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.920
I always feel...

260
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.370
I always feel

261
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.450
that it...

262
00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:41.800
I don't know.

263
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:42.680
Nothing.

264
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:44.560
Have a look.

265
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.010
Have a look.

266
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.330
Miss, take a look.

267
00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.330
Miss, it's...

268
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.330
The pearls are very big.

269
00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:53.010
It's my first time seeing such big ones.

270
00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.400
I...

271
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.760
They don't fit me, do they?

272
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:11.130
It's a little high-key.

273
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.520
Let me take them down.

274
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.210
Miss,

275
00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.370
how much are the pearls?

276
00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.680
I think they must be expensive.

277
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.400
The big one is 30 pence.

278
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:19.640
30 pence?

279
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.090
Well, how about the small one?

280
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.490
15 pence each.

281
00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.160
15 pence each?

282
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:33.920
Thank you.

283
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:35.610
You're welcome.

284
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:37.010
The price of pearls here

285
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.210
is a fifth of the capital's.

286
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.400
A fifth!

287
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.850
I can buy pearls here,

288
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.250
powder them,

289
00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.210
and add them

290
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.730
into my Feiwan Face Cream.

291
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:46.010
It couldn't only whiten skins

292
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.880
but also reduce my cost.

293
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.450
That's great.

294
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:52.680
Look.

295
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.680
Fresh flowers.

296
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.370
Ma'am,

297
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:55.520
what flower is it?

298
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.040
It's called Jidan.

299
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.250
Jidan?

300
00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.850
You're not local, are you?

301
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.160
Girls in Haifang

302
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:02.250
use Jidan

303
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:03.490
as a natural hair ornament

304
00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:04.640
and pin it on their hair.

305
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:05.490
Sir,

306
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.250
why not buy some for your wife?

307
00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.090
Pack them up.

308
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.610
What is this horn-like flower?

309
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:16.450
They are not horn-like flowers.

310
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:17.850
It's called calla.

311
00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:18.490
Sorry?

312
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.920
Calla.

313
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.250
Calla.

314
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:22.640
Madam,

315
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.560
you can buy some and enjoy them at home,

316
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:25.920
but don't eat it.

317
00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.370
If so,

318
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.280
you will be poisoned and faint,

319
00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.490
and your lips will be numb.

320
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.730
No one will eat flowers.

321
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:34.490
Ma'am,

322
00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.920
I think this kind of flower
is very beautiful.

323
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.450
Pack some up,

324
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:37.920
okay?

325
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.280
Yes.

326
00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:38.920
Thank you.

327
00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:40.920
Ma'am,

328
00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.090
you have so many kinds of flowers,

329
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:43.760
and I'll buy them from you.

330
00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:45.400
It's a pleasure

331
00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:46.490
to supply flowers to you,

332
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:48.490
but all my flowers

333
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.490
are bought from outside.

334
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.010
Without the Dragon Gang's permission,

335
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.610
cargo ships can't dock.

336
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:55.450
You're lucky today.

337
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:56.850
I don't know

338
00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:58.280
when I can get the next cargo.

339
00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.560
Why does the Dragon Gang supervise

340
00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.850
the docking of cargo ships?

341
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:05.600
Sir, you don't know

342
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.560
that the Dragon Gang protects docks

343
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.690
under the Magistrate's Residence's order

344
00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.650
after the last magistrate died.

345
00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:12.010
Sir,

346
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.170
in fact,

347
00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:16.320
the Dragon Gang has many spies,

348
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:17.360
so you'd better

349
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.040
not ask about this matter.

350
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.320
Ma'am,

351
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:22.890
pack them up for me.

352
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.040
Give her money.

353
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:29.760
Here you are, Madam.

354
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:30.360
Thank you.

355
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.250
Thank you, Ma'am.

356
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:32.170
Goodbye.

357
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.410
Thank you, Ma'am.

358
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.760
Flowers!

359
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:36.890
Fresh flowers!

360
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.520
They are beautiful.

361
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.690
Are you hungry?

362
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:45.650
I'm feeling a bit hungry.

363
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:46.970
Let's eat some food.

364
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.760
Okay.

365
00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.650
Listen,

366
00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.490
there is a barbecue shop ahead

367
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.650
that is run by the Xie family.

368
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:52.490
Their barbecue is very delicious.

369
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:53.250
And there is a noodle shop

370
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.170
across the street.

371
00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.170
I forget its name,

372
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.690
but if I went to...

373
00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:01.250
What are you looking at?

374
00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.500
(Tingyun Restaurant)

375
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:05.520
This restaurant is also good.

376
00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:07.280
Let's go.

377
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.890
Hurry up. I'm starving.

378
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:17.210
Waiter.

379
00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.080
Mister and Madam,

380
00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:19.320
please.

381
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.280
Why is there no one in your restaurant

382
00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:22.360
when it's lunchtime?

383
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:24.800
Please sit here.

384
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.360
Please.

385
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.690
Let's order food.

386
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:28.280
Here is the menu.

387
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:30.730
I want...

388
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.690
The Mixed Fresh Cucumber costs two taels.

389
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.560
The Three Colors of Threads
in Sour Sauce costs five taels.

390
00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:38.280
The Steamed Carp costs 15 taels.

391
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:40.970
I didn't expect your price

392
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:41.970
to be so high.

393
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.320
It's too expensive.

394
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:45.210
No wonder

395
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:46.970
you don't have a customer.

396
00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:50.040
Let's go to another restaurant.

397
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.010
Sangyu,

398
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:52.520
how about

399
00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:53.690
we eat here?

400
00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:59.800
How silly you are.

401
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:01.320
It's obviously a tourist trap.

402
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.250
Let's leave.

403
00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:04.650
We'd better take things as they come.

404
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.170
What's wrong with you?

405
00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:07.840
You really want to eat food here?

406
00:19:10.450 --> 00:19:11.450
Eat it yourself. I don't have money.

407
00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:12.970
Well...

408
00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.010
Don't leave, Madam.

409
00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:14.360
I'm going home.

410
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:14.890
Madam.

411
00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:17.010
Goodbye.

412
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.520
Hope to see you again.

413
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:22.600
Let's go.

414
00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.800
What a spendthrift.

415
00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:33.840
Waiter, come here.

416
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:36.800
What's wrong, Mister?

417
00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.010
Tell your boss Mr. Lu

418
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.890
to cook food

419
00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:44.520
according to this standard.

420
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.690
I don't know

421
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:46.730
what you mean, Magistrate.

422
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.360
How do you know I'm a magistrate?

423
00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.210
Tell him

424
00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:56.560
not to deal with me

425
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.690
in the same way

426
00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.930
as he did to the last magistrate.

427
00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:03.840
It can't work.

428
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.650
Mr. Yuan, I've asked around.

429
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:11.800
Each kind of cargo

430
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:12.210
in the market

431
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:13.520
has suppliers for sentinel procurement,

432
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.170
and all cargo ships

433
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.360
have to dock

434
00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:16.970
under the Dragon Gang's order.

435
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.120
The chief of the Dragon Gang,

436
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:18.730
Shen Liancheng,

437
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.970
should be one of the members

438
00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:20.890
of the Tea Gang that we're looking for.

439
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.800
Think of a way

440
00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:23.560
to join the Dragon Gang.

441
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:24.800
Find out the truth.

442
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.600
Okay.

443
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:39.840
Who are you?

444
00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:41.410
What do you want to do?

445
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.120
Warn your husband

446
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:46.250
that he should keep a low profile

447
00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.410
when he's in Haifang.

448
00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.520
You're threatening me, aren't you?

449
00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:55.120
Tell me

450
00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.360
who sent you here.

451
00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:58.840
You've asked too much.

452
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.170
You'd better go back with me

453
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:02.040
obediently.

454
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.520
Otherwise,

455
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.410
don't blame me for not showing mercy.

456
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.520
I warn you

457
00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.280
not to hurt me.

458
00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.320
This flower is poisonous.

459
00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:12.210
If you dare to hurt me,

460
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.450
I won't show mercy.

461
00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:14.360
Poisonous?

462
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:14.970
Don't...

463
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.650
I don't think so.

464
00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:21.360
You're just kidding.

465
00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:31.250
It's indeed poisonous.

466
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:34.360
I warned you before.

467
00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.760
Go to a physician now.

468
00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:49.450
Take her away.

469
00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.560
Your Lordship, you're back.

470
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.650
We have a clue

471
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:04.600
of the thing you
asked us to investigate.

472
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:05.650
How is the process?

473
00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:07.930
Lu Dekui, the butler,

474
00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.040
is indeed not ordinary.

475
00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:10.450
He has another identity.

476
00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:12.040
He owns Tingyun Restaurant, right?

477
00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.410
You've known that, Your Lordship?

478
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:15.760
I happened to see that

479
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:17.210
when hanging out today.

480
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:17.840
By the way,

481
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:18.970
check what businesses

482
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.080
in Haifang

483
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:20.800
belong to

484
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:21.930
the Dragon Gang.

485
00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:22.360
Yes.

486
00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.210
Where is Sangyu?

487
00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:25.210
Her Ladyship

488
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:27.040
hasn't come back yet.

489
00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:29.320
No?

490
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:32.690
Where is my wife?

491
00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.600
I don't understand

492
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:35.520
what you mean.

493
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.080
You don't understand?

494
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.210
Why do you have time

495
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:39.930
to be the butler
of the Magistrate's Residence

496
00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.650
while running
Tingyun Restaurant, Lu Dekui?

497
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.800
Is it because

498
00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:43.970
the Dragon Gang doesn't
pay you enough money?

499
00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:49.450
Let me ask you one last time.

500
00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:52.040
Where is my wife?

501
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:54.120
She's...

502
00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.520
If you don't answer me,

503
00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:01.040
I'll put you

504
00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.890
into the coffin in the room.

505
00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:03.600
Please spare my life.

506
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:04.800
Please.

507
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:05.760
It should be

508
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:06.690
Li Ming,

509
00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.650
who is from Jiumu Casino.

510
00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.760
He said

511
00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:09.560
to prevail over you

512
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.080
yesterday.

513
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.280
Jiumu Casino?

514
00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.690
Yes.

515
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:17.650
You came to me

516
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.250
before I came to you.

517
00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:22.760
I give you two hours to
leave the Magistrate's Residence

518
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.840
- with your men.
- Let's go.

519
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:43.760
Ms. Nie.

520
00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.280
You're awake.

521
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.800
Mr. Yuan?

522
00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:47.730
Are you fine?

523
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:48.930
Does your head hurt?

524
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.800
I'm fine.

525
00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.730
Am I

526
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.560
in the capital?

527
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:57.840
You're in my residence in Haifang.

528
00:23:58.520 --> 00:23:59.170
Yes.

529
00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:00.170
I'm in...

530
00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:01.600
Are you also in Haifang?

531
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.170
I'm a wandering businessman

532
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.890
and happen to do business in Haifang.

533
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:06.250
I didn't expect

534
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.490
to meet you again

535
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:08.560
coincidentally.

536
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.410
I remember

537
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.560
I was hit by someone

538
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.210
while running on the road.

539
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:24.970
Was it you?

540
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:26.600
Yes.

541
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.650
I beat the bandits away

542
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:31.520
and saved you.

543
00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.010
Then

544
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:37.560
have the bandits been caught?

545
00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.560
They escaped.

546
00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.250
I think

547
00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.170
it must be related to Ning Yuxuan.

548
00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:48.560
I'll go to him.

549
00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:49.930
Ms. Nie,

550
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:51.970
Mr. Ning isn't in the mansion now.

551
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.520
Where is he?

552
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.600
I heard

553
00:24:55.890 --> 00:24:56.970
that he went to a casino.

554
00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.730
Casino?

555
00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.360
Why does he go there?

556
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:03.040
I don't know.

557
00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.360
He conforms to local customs very fast.

558
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.010
You aren't good at anything.

559
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:15.490
Mr. Li, I...

560
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:16.080
Stop saying nonsense.

561
00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:17.490
You can't even catch a woman.

562
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.080
(Li Ming)
- You don't deserve your height. - I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

563
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.450
Yes.

564
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:33.840
Good.

565
00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:35.560
He actually dares to go to my place.

566
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.360
I didn't know you came here, Mr. Ning.

567
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.170
Sorry to welcome you

568
00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.360
in time.

569
00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:50.930
Do you know me?

570
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:52.800
I've been living in Haifang

571
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:54.120
for many years,

572
00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.970
and I prepare a gift

573
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:57.730
for each magistrate.

574
00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.280
I'm preparing a gift for you,

575
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.560
but you just came to me yourself.

576
00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:01.890
Haven't you

577
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:03.760
given me the gift already?

578
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.210
Tell me where my wife is.

579
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:08.690
Mr. Ning,

580
00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:09.730
it's you that failed

581
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:10.690
to keep an eye on your wife,

582
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.280
so why do you ask me for her?

583
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:13.840
It's very ridiculous, isn't it?

584
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.120
Mr. Ning, let me tell you.

585
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.450
All girls I like

586
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.450
are from Zuixian Pavilion

587
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.890
and Shuiyan House,

588
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.360
and I've never seen your wife.

589
00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.280
How dare you!

590
00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.080
Well, Mr. Ning,

591
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:34.080
I don't mind if you want to

592
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.360
ask me about her,

593
00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.170
but everything in my casino

594
00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.410
needs to be gambled.

595
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.890
If you win,

596
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.490
I may tell you the news

597
00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:43.730
once I get them.

598
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:44.890
On the contrary,

599
00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.410
if you lose,

600
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.650
I want

601
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.080
a reward.

602
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.320
What reward do you want?

603
00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:56.730
Look at my shoes.

604
00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:58.890
They don't fit my feet.

605
00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.760
Each magistrate of Haifang

606
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:02.040
is my friend

607
00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:03.890
and often helps me to put them on.

608
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:05.520
Well,

609
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:06.690
if you lose,

610
00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:08.840
please put on my shoes for me.

611
00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:14.760
Mr. Ning.

612
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.600
It's not a big deal.

613
00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.690
It's not a big deal.

614
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.450
Come on. Let's continue.

615
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.840
Order someone to check where Sangyu is.

616
00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:25.650
Yes.

617
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:28.010
Come on.

618
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.890
I change my bet.

619
00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:31.080
Come here and have a look.

620
00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:32.450
He lost again.

621
00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.410
Yes.

622
00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.360
He lost another 100 taels.

623
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:36.760
How could he have so many taels

624
00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:37.800
as a magistrate?

625
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:38.210
Yes.

626
00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:38.970
Why does he have over 100 taels?

627
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.120
Am I right?

628
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.800
He isn't angry at all.

629
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.170
What should he do?

630
00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:44.080
Yes.

631
00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:53.520
It's a triple.

632
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.170
Yes.

633
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.600
It's a triple again.

634
00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:59.080
Mr. Ning,

635
00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.840
it seems I'm so lucky today,

636
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.800
and I've won you two rounds.

637
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.320
If you lose the last round,

638
00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:08.840
you have to put on my shoes for me.

639
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.080
Are you done?

640
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:45.600
Mr. Ning,

641
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.490
open it.

642
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.490
It seems I win.

643
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:14.930
Mr. Ning,

644
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.760
it's a misunderstanding.

645
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:18.690
I didn't put lead

646
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.840
into dice.

647
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.650
Lead?

648
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.690
He cheated us.

649
00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:23.080
No, it's not me.

650
00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.080
Return the money.

651
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:25.470
It's here.

652
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:27.560
Excuse me. Please make way for me.

653
00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:28.450
Excuse me.

654
00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:29.080
Guys,

655
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.360
have you heard

656
00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:31.840
that the new magistrate

657
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:32.650
bet over 100 taels

658
00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.080
when gambling?

659
00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.760
So what?

660
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.120
He's lost

661
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.080
nearly 1,000 taels.

662
00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:38.970
Yes.

663
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.490
He's lost so much.

664
00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.450
It's true.

665
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.970
- Ning Yuxuan.
- Over 100 taels.

666
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.840
I doubt

667
00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:44.320
if he's a real magistrate.

668
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.210
Make way for me.

669
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.360
Who is she?

670
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.280
Return the money!

671
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:54.890
I didn't expect you

672
00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:56.280
to make Jiumu Casino

673
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.010
the most famous casino in Haifang

674
00:29:58.170 --> 00:29:59.410
in the way of putting lead into dice.

675
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:01.450
Gui Bai,

676
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:04.360
close down this casino.

677
00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:04.840
Yes.

678
00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:06.120
Mr. Ning, please listen to me.

679
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:06.970
Go to him.

680
00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:08.490
It must be a misunderstanding.

681
00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.120
- They are not mine.
- Sir.

682
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:10.890
- Sir.
- Sir.

683
00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:11.210
No.

684
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.760
- They are not mine.
- You...

685
00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:13.490
Sir.

686
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:14.410
Ning Yuxuan.

687
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.450
Sangyu.

688
00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:30.890
Actually,

689
00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:32.760
I can explain it to you.

690
00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:34.760
Well,

691
00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:35.650
these four girls

692
00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.010
surrounded me

693
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:37.360
and then,

694
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:38.690
that's what you see.

695
00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.410
No.

696
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:44.800
What happened?

697
00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:45.650
Who is she?

698
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.490
Everyone,

699
00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:47.690
I need to

700
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:49.280
deal with some family affairs

701
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.490
to readjust the family culture.

702
00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:52.690
I...

703
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:53.410
It's...

704
00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:55.280
I don't want to hurt the innocent,

705
00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.520
so if you don't want to be hit,

706
00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.010
get out of my way!

707
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:02.890
Get out of my way.

708
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:03.520
It's not like what you think.

709
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:04.890
Your Ladyship, please calm down.

710
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.490
I don't want to hit you.
Get out of my way.

711
00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:11.080
I'll count to three.

712
00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:11.930
Get out of my way.

713
00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:12.560
One.

714
00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.560
Gui Bai, explain it for me.

715
00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.450
Two.

716
00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:15.450
Say it.

717
00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:16.450
Three.

718
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.520
- You...
- Gui Bai. Oh.

719
00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:18.760
Look at what you have done today.

720
00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:19.450
How dare you gamble.

721
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:20.120
Gui Bai is here.

722
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.410
Go ask him. Go ahead.

723
00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:22.360
How dare you!

724
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.890
Move your hands away.

725
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:26.410
No.

726
00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.490
Is he okay?

727
00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:02.320
I...

728
00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.040
You...

729
00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.040
Sangyu,

730
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:06.520
you're brave.

731
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.490
This one

732
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:08.450
is the black-hearted owner

733
00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.730
of this casino.

734
00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:10.890
His death isn't to be regretted.

735
00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:12.970
Thank you, Sangyu.

736
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:18.080
Am I that amazing?

737
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:25.410
But we aren't done.

738
00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:26.690
Don't think it's ended.

739
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:29.410
Let's go back home first.

740
00:32:30.170 --> 00:32:31.600
Calm down.

741
00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.250
Fine.

742
00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:54.800
Stop looking.

743
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:55.730
He has defrauded much money.

744
00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.970
He should have been
caught a long time ago.

745
00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:57.600
How's it?

746
00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:58.650
Isn't it because of me?

747
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:08.890
Look at you.

748
00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:10.320
If you made it clear early,

749
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:12.040
I wouldn't have been that angry.

750
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:13.800
But you didn't give me time
to make an explanation.

751
00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:14.490
You mean it's my...

752
00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:15.840
But I indeed came to the casino

753
00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.840
to look for you.

754
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:18.930
How could I know that?

755
00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:19.800
The moment I entered,

756
00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:21.210
I saw a group of women surround you,

757
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.360
so I got angry naturally.

758
00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:22.890
I'm sorry.

759
00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:23.450
It's...

760
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:27.080
Good.

761
00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:29.930
But

762
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:32.320
who saved you?

763
00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:35.600
Someone saved me when you weren't there.

764
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.120
Fortunately,

765
00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.010
I met a friend

766
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.930
from the capital.

767
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.250
Otherwise,

768
00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:42.280
I would have died.

769
00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:43.840
Friend?

770
00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:44.490
Yes.

771
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:45.360
His name is Yuan Lang,

772
00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.360
a wandering businessman.

773
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.930
And he happened to
do business in Haifang.

774
00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.730
You need to thank him.

775
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:53.560
He comes here from the capital?

776
00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.580
Check that.

777
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.650
What are you doing?

778
00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:03.170
Don't move.

779
00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:03.930
Wait.

780
00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.360
There are so many people.

781
00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.280
Don't move.

782
00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:07.280
Don't move.

783
00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.240
Yes, he caught a bad man for us.

784
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.640
I want everyone to see

785
00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:14.200
I'm the magistrate's wife.

786
00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:17.450
No one will bully you in the future.

787
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.680
He's good at the first sight.

788
00:34:21.930 --> 00:34:23.490
The magistrate is very good.

789
00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.120
Yes.

790
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:25.600
He did a good thing for us.

791
00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:26.890
Yes.

792
00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:28.120
We're lucky.

793
00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:33.520
Good. He's a good magistrate.

794
00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:34.410
Good magistrate.

795
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:10.450
Mr. Wang.

796
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.040
The Dragon Gang

797
00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:17.860
(Wang Jinyao)
is very unscrupulous.

798
00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.850
They dared to kidnap
the new magistrate's wife

799
00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.490
on his first day of taking office.

800
00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.450
Fortunately, his wife is safe.

801
00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:29.330
Go

802
00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:32.370
and send him a visiting invitation.

803
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.240
Invite him to attend

804
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.040
my birthday party tomorrow.

805
00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.680
Let's

806
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.120
comfort him.

807
00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:43.850
Yes.

808
00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:47.450
Miss Wang.

809
00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:51.620
(Wang Yueli)

810
00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:52.240
Father,

811
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.370
it'll be your birthday party tomorrow.

812
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:55.850
Why haven't you slept yet?

813
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:58.410
We'll have

814
00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.970
an important guest tomorrow,

815
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.080
and you'd better keep quiet.

816
00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.330
Don't be rude.

817
00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.200
Who is the guest?

818
00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:10.770
The new magistrate,

819
00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.930
Ning Yuxuan.

820
00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:15.240
Father,

821
00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.120
he's just a magistrate.

822
00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:19.720
You don't need to treat him seriously.

823
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.640
He's not ordinary.

824
00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:22.850
He was sent

825
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:23.770
to Haifang

826
00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:25.560
by His Majesty,

827
00:36:26.290 --> 00:36:27.640
so you know

828
00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.370
the advantages and disadvantages.

829
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:31.640
Anyway,

830
00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:33.640
keep quiet.

831
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.450
I see, Father.

832
00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:43.930
Your Ladyship,

833
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.600
we've checked many shops,

834
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.290
but none of them is suitable.

835
00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:51.290
They are either small

836
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:52.770
or remote

837
00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:54.490
or

838
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.970
too

839
00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.720
damp.

840
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.410
If we can't find one,

841
00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:09.720
how about

842
00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:11.370
setting up a stall?

843
00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:14.120
We'd better not.

844
00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.450
Set up a stall...

845
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.330
But if we can't

846
00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:22.200
find a suitable shop,

847
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:23.930
we can't make do with a bad one.

848
00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.410
Ms. Nie.

849
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.560
Mr. Yuan.

850
00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.450
Why do you always

851
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.680
have a long face whenever I see you?

852
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.240
What are you worried about?

853
00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:37.850
Don't mention that.

854
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:38.850
I've hung out

855
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:39.890
on all streets

856
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.770
of Haifang,

857
00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:41.520
but I didn't find

858
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.970
a suitable shop.

859
00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:44.600
Ms. Nie,

860
00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.120
I happened

861
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.970
to see a good shop

862
00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.120
a few days ago,

863
00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.200
and I wonder if you like it.

864
00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.160
How about I lead you to have a look?

865
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.370
Really?

866
00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:55.890
Sure.

867
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.330
It's here.

868
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:07.850
Sir.

869
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:10.330
Do you come here to check the shop?

870
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.970
Everyone, please check it as you like.

871
00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.010
My shop

872
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.290
faces south,

873
00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:17.410
which is the street,

874
00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.600
and it has windows on its north.

875
00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.290
There is a counter,

876
00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:21.040
and next to it

877
00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.240
are empty shelves.

878
00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.010
Do you have a storage?

879
00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:24.770
Yes.

880
00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:27.120
Behind this door is the backyard,

881
00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.330
and there is a big storage.

882
00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.290
It's in a dark place, and is dry,

883
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.290
cool and ventilative.

884
00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:32.160
It's perfect.

885
00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.720
What do you think, Ms. Nie?

886
00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:34.560
Do you like it?

887
00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.560
Yes.

888
00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:41.640
Since his shop is so good,

889
00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:42.720
have you asked him

890
00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:43.640
the price?

891
00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.290
I...

892
00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:47.970
Sir,

893
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:49.410
can you

894
00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:50.770
tell me

895
00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.410
the price of this shop?

896
00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.680
If you like my shop,

897
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:54.600
I'll give you the preferential price,

898
00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:55.640
800 taels.

899
00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:58.410
It's worth it,

900
00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.040
but I don't

901
00:38:59.120 --> 00:38:59.810
have enough money today,

902
00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:01.200
so I'll come next time.

903
00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:02.490
Let's leave.

904
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:04.010
Wait, Ms. Nie.

905
00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.240
Sir, I'll buy this shop.

906
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:12.080
No, it's...

907
00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.520
Sir, you have good taste.

908
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.080
You're very forthright.

909
00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:15.770
No, Mr. Yuan.

910
00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:16.490
Wait a minute.

911
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.640
I'll go to take the title deed.

912
00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.160
Sir.

913
00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:19.010
No.

914
00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:21.600
Mr. Yuan,

915
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:23.010
I can't accept your money.

916
00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:23.850
Haven't we agreed

917
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:24.850
to do business together?

918
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:26.080
You can't go back on your word.

919
00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:26.930
I've owed you

920
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:27.720
a favor before,

921
00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:28.770
and I can't owe you money.

922
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:29.410
Listen,

923
00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:30.770
this shop's position is perfect.

924
00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:31.520
You don't need to persuade me.

925
00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:32.490
I've made the decision.

926
00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.120
I can't accept it.

927
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.040
The biggest odeum,

928
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.520
Shuiyan House,

929
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.370
is in the east.

930
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:38.120
Every night,

931
00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.040
officials and rich men

932
00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.490
will take girls there.

933
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.080
And this shop is on the way there.

934
00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:43.520
Shuiyan House?

935
00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.200
Yes.

936
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:45.680
There are many officials' residences

937
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.680
in the west,

938
00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.850
and rich ladies will

939
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.120
hang out.

940
00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.370
This unique position

941
00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:53.040
is the best place

942
00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:53.720
to run your

943
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:55.240
cosmetic business.

944
00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:57.850
How do you know that?

945
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:01.520
I...

946
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.040
I heard it from my friend.

947
00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:06.560
I see.

948
00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.680
Okay.

949
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:11.890
I'll take this shop.

950
00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.600
However, Mr. Yuan,

951
00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:14.810
let's make a deal.

952
00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:16.720
I just borrow your money
for the time being,

953
00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:18.290
and I'll pay you back

954
00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:19.850
as soon as I have enough money to run.

955
00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:20.490
Okay.

956
00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.410
Let's do as you say.

957
00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.290
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

(Wang Jinyao)
Birthday party in Wang's Mansion.

959
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:31.120
Wang Jinyao

960
00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:32.600
couldn't bear it anymore.

961
00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.160
I think

962
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:41.930
we should tell this information...

963
00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:42.490
Why are you

964
00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:43.560
so happy today, Sangyu?

965
00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.410
You're here.

966
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.560
I was going to you.

967
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.160
Did you find the shop?

968
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.040
More than that.

969
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:51.770
Listen,

970
00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:52.450
the shop I found

971
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.370
is the best one

972
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.560
in Haifang.

973
00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.560
Is that so?

974
00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:57.720
Therefore,

975
00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:58.850
I officially

976
00:40:58.970 --> 00:40:59.890
inform you

977
00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:00.770
that my shop

978
00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:01.330
is going to open soon,

979
00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:02.410
and I invite all of you

980
00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.930
to go there.

981
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:07.680
Sangyu,

982
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.010
I have

983
00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.890
a perfect idea

984
00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:11.970
to let you

985
00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.450
know celebrities in Haifang.

986
00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.330
They

987
00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.010
are all your potential customers.

988
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:18.450
Really?

989
00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:27.330
You are not

990
00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:29.450
playing tricks on me, are you?

991
00:41:31.410 --> 00:41:33.290
Will you go or not?

992
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.330
Never mind if you won't go.

993
00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:39.490
I'll go.

994
00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:41.890
I'll wait for you then.

995
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:45.970
Prepare yourself.

996
00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:46.930
We'll set off soon.

997
00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.340
(We sincerely invite you
and your wife to the party.)

998
00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:56.890
Celebrities.

999
00:41:57.970 --> 00:41:58.720
