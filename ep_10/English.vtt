=Romance of a Twin Flower=

2
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.980
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.520
Okay, see you tomorrow.

4
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.440
Your Lordship.

5
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.690
I led some men

6
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.650
to patrol again.

7
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.320
Some people looked suspicious.

8
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.520
Is everything set up?

9
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.520
Yes.

10
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.600
Why are you looking at me?

11
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.600
Tonight,

12
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.010
you'll sleep in the woodshed with me.

13
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.290
Why

14
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.640
would I do that?

15
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.090
Gui Bai.

16
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.600
Yes.

17
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.880
What are you doing?

18
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.090
I have many enemies.

19
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.640
It won't be a safe journey.

20
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.250
For those assassins,

21
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.970
this premium roomâ€¦

22
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.880
Will be

23
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.810
their first target.

24
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.370
No wonder

25
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.850
you didn't fight me for the room.

26
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.160
You're using me as a target.

27
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.640
Right?

28
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.130
Let's go.

29
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.880
It's not safe here.

30
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.760
What about Muxu?

31
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.720
Your Ladyship, don't worry.

32
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.530
I'll take care of her.

33
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.410
Can I not go to the woodshed?

34
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.920
No.

35
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.440
- I won't sleep in the same bed...
- Shush.

36
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.720
with you.

37
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.810
What are you looking at?

38
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.880
I can see nothing.

39
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.690
Don't make any trouble.

40
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.320
Stop playing tricks.

41
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.520
I didn't see any other customers

42
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.840
in this inn.

43
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.440
How could there be an assassin?

44
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.170
You must be unwilling

45
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.730
to let me sleep in the premium room.

46
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.370
So, you're doing this on purpose, right?

47
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.520
If you think this way,

48
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.250
then so be it.

49
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.320
I'm warning you

50
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.320
that I'm not going to share a bed

51
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.440
with you.

52
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.840
Do you hear me?

53
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.930
What are you looking at?

54
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.280
(If you are not Nie Sangyu,)

55
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:02.730
(then who are you?)

56
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.440
(I saw a plum blossom shaped birthmark)

57
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.880
(on Nie Sangyu's back shoulder.)

58
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.080
Why are you staring at me?

59
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.490
Tell you what,

60
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.170
you must not have any impure thoughts.

61
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.930
You heard that?

62
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.570
There's only one premium room.

63
00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.690
Move.

64
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.130
I've been waiting for you
for quite a while.

65
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:46.930
Wake up.

66
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.730
What are you doing?

67
00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.930
Don't touch me.

68
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.640
Be quiet.

69
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.400
I'll call for help.

70
00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:54.640
Let go of me.

71
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:55.400
Listen.

72
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.320
Let go of me.

73
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:56.810
Calm down.

74
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.520
Assassins?

75
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:10.930
Then let's run.

76
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:12.370
What are you waiting for?

77
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.050
You just stay here.

78
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.320
I won't let anything happen to you.

79
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.730
Trust me.

80
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.250
Where are you going?

81
00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.970
Be careful.

82
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.560
Let's go.

83
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.130
Your Lordship,

84
00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.760
all assassins were killed.

85
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.130
We must not take this lightly.

86
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.400
Ling Jianxing

87
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.920
won't just send these assassins.

88
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.970
Send two men to protect my wife.

89
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:54.800
Yes, Your Lordship.

90
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:56.160
All the others,

91
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.490
take your weapons and follow me out

92
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:01.610
to give them a surprise.

93
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:57.220
(Under professional movement instructions,
no animal was harmed)

94
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:38.730
Where is Ning Yuxuan?

95
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:39.490
Your Ladyship,

96
00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:40.370
His Lordship told us

97
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.250
to protect you here.

98
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:44.250
I'm going to find him.

99
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.090
Go.

100
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:31.800
Ning Yuxuan!

101
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.090
Your Ladyship.

102
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:42.970
Don't move.

103
00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.130
One more move,

104
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.130
and I'll kill her.

105
00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.250
I worried about you.

106
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.160
So, I ran out.

107
00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:55.730
Tell your men

108
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:56.970
to back off five miles away.

109
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.280
Right now.

110
00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.160
Sir,

111
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.130
it's no use

112
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.280
to threaten him with me.

113
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.640
You're wasting your time.

114
00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.730
It's my fault this time.

115
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:17.560
I'll take it on myself.

116
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.330
You may leave.

117
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:23.600
Back off.

118
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:29.680
Back off.

119
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.330
Your Lordship...

120
00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.210
Back off!

121
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.130
Ning Yuxuan,

122
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.210
put your sword down.

123
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:16.280
Go.

124
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:16.880
Father.

125
00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:17.640
Yuxuan.

126
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:18.880
Father.

127
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.090
Father.

128
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.880
Put your sword down.

129
00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.250
Father, no, Father!

130
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.880
Father.

131
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.010
Father.

132
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.680
Put your sword down!

133
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:35.760
Father!

134
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.560
Yuxuan,

135
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.280
close your eyes.

136
00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:43.920
Put your sword down.

137
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.640
Father, no, Father!

138
00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:47.490
No.

139
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:23.920
No, Father.

140
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.280
Father!

141
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:34.920
Walk over.

142
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:35.880
Leave me alone. Just go.

143
00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.880
Ning Yuxuan,

144
00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.090
just go, and leave me alone.

145
00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:43.450
Sir,

146
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.160
let's just talk.

147
00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.040
You have my life.

148
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:48.850
You can kill me.

149
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.250
Don't hurt him.

150
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.330
No.

151
00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.400
Ning Yuxuan!

152
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:00.970
Ning Yuxuan.

153
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:08.680
How do you feel?

154
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:47.370
Jump.

155
00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:57.700
(Yifang Inn)

156
00:17:05.450 --> 00:17:06.360
Your Lordship, you're awake.

157
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:11.320
Did you catch them all?

158
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:13.600
We killed half of them

159
00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:14.760
and caught the rest.

160
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.120
But those caught killed themselves

161
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:18.760
before we could interrogate them.

162
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:21.930
It's okay.

163
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.490
I know

164
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.930
who is behind this.

165
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:33.840
We're close to Haifang.

166
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.280
Mr. Ling has become more anxious.

167
00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:40.410
They don't want me to get near Haifang.

168
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.560
I'm not that easy to be dealt with.

169
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.930
Your Lordship,

170
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.170
you're foresighted and blessed.

171
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.760
Nothing bad would happen to you.

172
00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:50.360
But Your Lordship,

173
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:55.010
why did you put your sword down?

174
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.120
Your Lordship, you passed out last night.

175
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.080
It's Her Ladyship who brought you back.

176
00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.080
Where is Nie Sangyu?

177
00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:19.280
She's decocting the herbs in the yard

178
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.250
for treating your wound.

179
00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.210
Send someone back
to the capital immediately

180
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.010
to find out Nie Sangyu's whereabouts.

181
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.220
Isn't she in the yard?

182
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.760
She

183
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.070
may not be Nie Sangyu.

184
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.280
Nie Sangyu has a birthmark
on her shoulder,

185
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.120
but I didn't see it on her.

186
00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:24.730
Then who is the one in the yard?

187
00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.280
Go find it out.

188
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:26.840
Yes, Your Lordship.

189
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:36.930
I am the hostess of this mansion.

190
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.560
I don't allow you to marry her.

191
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:39.280
Since we can't be a couple

192
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:40.730
in this life,

193
00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.360
no one else can think about it.

194
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.520
Honey.

195
00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:44.360
I heard

196
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:45.010
there was some misunderstanding

197
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.520
between us.

198
00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:47.490
But I believe that

199
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:48.320
it won't affect

200
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.490
our relationship, right?

201
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:50.410
Nie Sangyu.

202
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.800
Your crime of disturbing

203
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.320
the Ning's Mansion is unforgivable.

204
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:54.930
Why should I admit to

205
00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:55.930
something I haven't done?

206
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.600
Nie Sangyu has studied lower script
since she was a child,

207
00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:58.520
and her characters are delicate.

208
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.410
But these profound and powerful words

209
00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.360
cannot be written

210
00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:02.520
without more than ten years of practice.

211
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:03.320
Ever since I fell off a cliff,

212
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.360
I've lost all my memories

213
00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:05.210
before the fall.

214
00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.280
I survived by luck.

215
00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:08.690
So,

216
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.520
it's kind of a rebirth.

217
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.800
So did something else

218
00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.970
pop out

219
00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:13.840
of your mind?

220
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:15.360
Something else?

221
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.600
For example,

222
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:18.760
memories from the past.

223
00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:27.190
â™ªOnce anchored in your rainy eyesâ™ª

224
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.320
(Your Ladyship, you're finally back.)

225
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:30.650
I was so scared.

226
00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:31.280
How did His Lordship

227
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.840
get injured so badly?

228
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:34.970
Your Ladyship, are you all right?

229
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:35.930
I'm fine.

230
00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:36.930
Muxu,

231
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.080
did you prepare these herbs

232
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:39.280
by following the prescription?

233
00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:41.320
There must be no mistake.

234
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.800
They were all prepared

235
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:43.760
according to your instructions.

236
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:45.280
That's good.

237
00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.250
(I should have guessed it.)

238
00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:50.890
(You couldn't be)

239
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:51.600
(the same person.)

240
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:52.210
Your Ladyship,

241
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.320
have you noticed

242
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:54.210
that His Lordship's attitude towards you

243
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.250
has changed a lot recently?

244
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:56.250
He seems

245
00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.360
not as indifferent as before.

246
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.730
This time, he evenâ€¦

247
00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:02.600
Ning Yuxuan,

248
00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:04.280
put your sword down.

249
00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:09.590
â™ªLooking at the rippling waves
in the starry riverâ™ª

250
00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.460
â™ªAnd plucking at the strings in my heartâ™ª

251
00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.660
â™ªWho has noticed their feelings
for each otherâ™ª

252
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:18.320
Your Ladyship?

253
00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:20.080
Your Ladyship?

254
00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:22.450
Your Ladyship.

255
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:26.970
Indeed,

256
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:28.520
he has changed a lot.

257
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.490
He has become so lecherous.

258
00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.800
(He always tries to harass me.)

259
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:35.730
(But)

260
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:37.800
(who are you?)

261
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:39.760
(Why do you)

262
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:41.210
(look exactly the same as her?)

263
00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:43.280
(Why did you)

264
00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:45.890
(suddenly appear in front of me?)

265
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:56.890
Boss.

266
00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.170
What have you found?

267
00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:00.930
Only guards from the Marquis's Mansion.

268
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.210
There's no sign of Ning Yuxuan

269
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.120
and Ms. Nie.

270
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:06.760
Well,

271
00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.490
Ning Yuxuan is really lucky.

272
00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.730
He escaped once again.

273
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:13.970
Boss,

274
00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.360
who do you think

275
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:16.520
are trying to kill Ning Yuxuan?

276
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.780
Are they from the Tea Gang too?

277
00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.200
It must be Ning Yuxuan's opponent.

278
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.210
(It's too risky to be around Ning Yuxuan.)

279
00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:33.760
(I must get my little sister away from him)

280
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.970
(as soon as possible.)

281
00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:39.320
Boss.

282
00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.730
Why are you looking at me like that?

283
00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:56.410
Thank you.

284
00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:01.970
No thanks.

285
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.490
I'm the one who should say thanks.

286
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.410
If it wasn't for me,

287
00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.410
you wouldn't get injured so badly.

288
00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.360
It has nothing to do with you.

289
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.210
Why do you say that?

290
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:14.800
Didn't you put your sword down

291
00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:16.450
for protecting me?

292
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.600
Is it hurting again?

293
00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:25.970
I'm okay.

294
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.360
Can you promise me

295
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:29.450
not to drop your sword again

296
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.730
if that happens again?

297
00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.080
No matter who it is for, including me.

298
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:32.930
Do you hear me?

299
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:34.120
Yes.

300
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:39.320
Including me.

301
00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:49.210
Sit by my side.

302
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.450
Sit by my side. Can't you hear me?

303
00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.280
Come on.

304
00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:00.070
Be careful.

305
00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.230
â™ªYoung man admires
the flowers and smilesâ™ª

306
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.240
â™ªBirds swaying on the branchesâ™ª

307
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:18.450
â™ªThe warm wind chasing after the shadowâ™ª

308
00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.040
No need.

309
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.480
â™ªI'm happy to see your smiling faceâ™ª

310
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:23.730
Come on.

311
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:25.600
No.

312
00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:26.250
Don't move.

313
00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:27.890
Or your wound will hurt again.

314
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.280
You may

315
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.410
just lean on me like this.

316
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.520
Do you feel more comfortable?

317
00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.230
â™ªNo matter how far the water flowsâ™ª

318
00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:37.410
Just like this.

319
00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.650
You may have a rest.

320
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.930
Don't move.

321
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:43.760
I'm here.

322
00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:46.250
You may rest assured

323
00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:47.690
that no one

324
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.320
could touch you again.

325
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:50.280
Don't let me

326
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:51.840
see those people again.

327
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.930
Otherwise, I would tear them apart.

328
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.080
It's okay. I'm here.

329
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:00.870
â™ªNo matter how far the water flowsâ™ª

330
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.430
â™ªAnd how far the road isâ™ª

331
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.430
â™ªThe time and I are growing old with youâ™ª

332
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:06.970
â™ªLet the wind blowâ™ª

333
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:08.480
â™ªThe boat floats in the waterâ™ª

334
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.190
Don't move.

335
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:11.860
â™ªSmiling while watching
shining stars and the bright moonâ™ª

336
00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:15.250
(In this world,)

337
00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:16.890
(you're the only one)

338
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:18.650
(who is willing to die with me.)

339
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.280
(The only thing I can do right now)

340
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.040
(is to help you get your memories back)

341
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.650
(and solve all mysteries.)

342
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:45.180
(Haifang)

343
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.930
Bravo, bravo!

344
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:21.810
Bravo!

345
00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.170
Bravo, bravo!

346
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.360
The street is so bustling.

347
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.520
The magistrate's residence
must be more luxurious.

348
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.010
Do you enjoy watching this?

349
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.520
Then enjoy yourself.

350
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:40.450
What do you mean?

351
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:42.890
We can bet with one bead.

352
00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:45.560
On what?

353
00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.840
You would miss the Ning's Mansion

354
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.970
after seeing the magistrate's residence.

355
00:26:51.970 --> 00:26:54.040
Is there any place

356
00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.170
even less pleasant than your mansion?

357
00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.080
I can bet with all my beads.

358
00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:01.490
You like beads so much.

359
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.080
Then

360
00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:05.730
I'll call you Hongzhu from now on.

361
00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:08.800
Hongzhu?

362
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.360
Hongzhu

363
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:12.730
sounds like "red pig".

364
00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.080
What kind of name is that?

365
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.890
Then I'll call you Lanzhu.

366
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:22.600
Lanzhu.

367
00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.080
Lanzhu?

368
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:24.650
Yes.

369
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.520
Lanzhu means

370
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.930
lazy pig.

371
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:32.560
Yeah, Lanzhu?

372
00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:33.690
Okay.

373
00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:35.250
Hongzhu.

374
00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:36.280
Lanzhu.

375
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:36.930
Hongzhu.

376
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:37.690
Lanzhu.

377
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.080
Lanzhu, Hongzhu.

378
00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:45.040
Fine.

379
00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.210
At least they sound like a good match.

380
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:05.300
(No Peace in the World)

381
00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:18.800
Sir.

382
00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.740
You must have failed again in the mission.

383
00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:22.820
I'm useless.

384
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.500
You can't even do such a little thing.

385
00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.220
How should I explain to His Highness?

386
00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:30.620
Sir,

387
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:31.620
Lord Tan sent someone here

388
00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.700
for delivering a secret letter.

389
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:40.500
(Don't act rashly.)

390
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.660
(Let Ning enter Haifang.)

391
00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.260
(Work together up and down.)

392
00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.020
(Borrow a knife to kill him.)

393
00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.620
Good. That's exactly what I want.

394
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:55.420
In this case,

395
00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:57.980
let's do it in Haifang,

396
00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:59.740
catching the rat in the hole.

397
00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.380
Ning Yuxuan.

398
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.540
(Ning)

399
00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:15.540
(Magistrate's Residence)

400
00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:26.940
Your Lordship.

401
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.420
It's such a big gift.

402
00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:32.580
Ning Yuxuan,

403
00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:34.740
is this where you'll work

404
00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.420
after traveling so far from the capital?

405
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:37.020
Yes.

406
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.420
Well,

407
00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:45.860
I think

408
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.580
you're not fully recovered yet.

409
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.420
Maybe we should go back,

410
00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.420
and come back when you're recovered.

411
00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:51.660
There is no need.

412
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.420
After taking your medicine,

413
00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:55.700
my wound

414
00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:56.820
is almost healed.

415
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.180
Yeah?

416
00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:03.860
Since we're already here,
let's make ourselves at home.

417
00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:17.820
Coming here to meet local people by fate.

418
00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:21.860
Hoping to...

419
00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:24.580
(Feel less guilty)

420
00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:28.100
Feel less gullty to the peopie.

421
00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.940
The words are wrongly written.

422
00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:34.940
Yeah.

423
00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:38.420
Look,

424
00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:40.580
even words on the plague
are wrongly written.

425
00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.220
This is definitely

426
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.820
not the right place to work.

427
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:43.700
Let's go.

428
00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.140
There's one stroke missing for "Kui"
[*Kui means guilt]

429
00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.100
and one extra stroke for "Min".
[*Min means people]

430
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.460
As a magistrate,

431
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.140
what's wrong

432
00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.500
with hoping to feel less guilty

433
00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:54.580
and thinking more about the people.

434
00:30:56.940 --> 00:30:58.940
How could someone who wrote this couplet

435
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.900
end up

436
00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.220
being accused of embezzlement

437
00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.900
and jumping off a cliff.

438
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:08.740
Let's go.

439
00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:10.980
Maybe

440
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.180
there are more surprises inside.

441
00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.020
Come on.

442
00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:15.380
Ning Yuxuan.

443
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.500
It's so scary here.

444
00:31:59.020 --> 00:31:59.660
Let's not go inside.

445
00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:01.940
What's so scary?

446
00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:03.700
No.

447
00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:36.140
(Law and Conscience)

448
00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.660
Is this the trial hall?

449
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.180
It's scarier than a mourning hall.

450
00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.420
Ning Yuxuan,

451
00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.620
you may stay here

452
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.420
if you want.

453
00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.580
I won't stay here with you.

454
00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:50.500
I'm not going to stay here alone.

455
00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.340
It's the rule

456
00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:55.500
for the magistrate's family to stay here.

457
00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.340
If you don't want to stay here,

458
00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.860
you may go check the backyard.

459
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:02.220
Backyard?

460
00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.740
But I must remind you

461
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.940
that you're a lady with imperial mandate,

462
00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.500
but not a lady calling for help.

463
00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:12.940
It's funny.

464
00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:34.660
How could the backyard

465
00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:35.940
be like this?

466
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.940
Yeah, it's so scary.

467
00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.860
That must be the bedroom.

468
00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:44.820
(Jiangzhen Pavilion)

469
00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:46.740
Come on,

470
00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.460
let's go take a look.

471
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.340
Don't be afraid.

472
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.380
It's okay.

473
00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:59.780
(Clean Prudent Diligent)

474
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:06.460
Your Lordship,

475
00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:08.500
do you want me

476
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:09.420
to find a cook?

477
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:11.260
No hurry.

478
00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.140
Let's wait for a little while.

479
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.260
What is this place?

480
00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:25.860
Your Ladyship,

481
00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.460
I'm afraid to go inside.

482
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.140
What's so scary?

483
00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:31.500
I don't believe

484
00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.460
that there're ghosts

485
00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.060
in broad daylight.

486
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:35.580
Your Ladyship.

487
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.420
My god!

488
00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.340
Ning Yuxuan.

489
00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:49.940
Help!

490
00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:51.060
Help! Ning Yuxuan.

491
00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:52.340
What's the matter?

492
00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:53.220
In the backyard,

493
00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.420
there isâ€¦

494
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:56.060
What?

495
00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:57.700
There isâ€¦

496
00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:18.860
I-It's here.

497
00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.420
I was so scared.

498
00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.940
Is this the dead man you told me?

499
00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:38.940
Let go of me.

500
00:35:39.140 --> 00:35:40.100
I'm scared.

501
00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.100
If you don't let go of me,

502
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:41.940
how could I check

503
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:43.420
whether there is a dead man inside it?

504
00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.340
Why are you talking to me like this?

505
00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:47.620
I'm so scared now.

506
00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:48.420
How can you talk to me

507
00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.380
like this?

508
00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.540
Can you be a little more reasonable?

509
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.060
I'm helping you check it.

510
00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.220
I'm a woman.

511
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.220
I'm scared.

512
00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:54.980
Are you not a woman

513
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.300
in normal times?

514
00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.100
How can you say that about me?

515
00:35:59.100 --> 00:35:59.780
It's empty.

516
00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:02.940
Empty?

517
00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:06.580
The former magistrate

518
00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:08.420
jumped off a cliff with all his families.

519
00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.300
He only left a letter written with blood

520
00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:10.700
to confess his guilt.

521
00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:11.860
None of his families

522
00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:12.900
is alive.

523
00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.980
Who would set up
the mourning hall for him?

524
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.700
And who

525
00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.140
placed the coffin here?

526
00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.460
So...

527
00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:27.460
What?

528
00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.260
So...

529
00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:32.420
This is a warning.

530
00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.100
I've never provoked them.

531
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.900
Why are they warning me?

532
00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.300
They are warning me.

533
00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.140
I see.

534
00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:50.260
They wanted to

535
00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.740
scare me.

536
00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.060
But these tricks

537
00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.340
wouldn't scare me off at all.

538
00:36:58.580 --> 00:36:59.140
But they

539
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:00.900
did scare the lady next to me,

540
00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.500
a second-rank lady with imperial mandate.

541
00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:11.820
Are you kidding?

542
00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:13.620
I just told you

543
00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:14.740
that it was weird inside here.

544
00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:15.780
It's just as expected.

545
00:37:16.460 --> 00:37:16.900
You don't look scared

546
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:18.380
at all.

547
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:19.420
Not at all.

548
00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.300
Since you're not scared,

549
00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:23.340
you'll stay here.

550
00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:23.860
You'd better

551
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.420
get the room cleaned up.

552
00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:28.420
Why is it me to clean it?

553
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.460
Because you said

554
00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.220
a second-rank lady with imperial mandate

555
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.500
has the premium room.

556
00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.140
I'm only a county magistrate
who can only stay

557
00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.620
in a woodshed or a wing-room.

558
00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:38.780
So, I'll go find a wing-room.

559
00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:39.700
No way.

560
00:37:40.300 --> 00:37:40.940
I disagree.

561
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:42.540
You stay in this room and clean it.

562
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:49.460
You will have one bead

563
00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:50.540
for cleaning this room.

564
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:52.380
Would you

565
00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.820
do it or not?

566
00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.020
There's no other choice.

567
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:03.380
You're a lazy pig anyway.

568
00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.780
Muxu, get the tools.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.020
Didn't you sleep well last night?

572
00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.460
You look sleepy.

Go back to sleep if you feel sleepy.

574
00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:33.500
Who...

575
00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.500
Who cleaned the floor?

576
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.420
Yeah.

577
00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.460
Who cleaned the place?

578
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:38.260
Come on.

579
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.580
Your Lordship.

580
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:43.540
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

581
00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.060
Your Lordship.

582
00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:48.420
Your Lordship,

583
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:50.740
I'm the butler here.

584
00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:51.420
I didn't know

585
00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:53.140
that you were coming today.

586
00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:54.220
Please forgive me

587
00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.980
for not meeting you earlier.

588
00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.420
It's okay.

589
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.460
The place is already cleaned.

590
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.620
And it's late today.

591
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.940
You may go back to rest.

592
00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.300
Tomorrow,

593
00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.380
do what you should do.

594
00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.420
Yes, sir.

595
00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.980
Let's go.

596
00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:30.900
They look so slouchy

597
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.420
and show little respect for you.

598
00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.420
They act not like servants at all.

599
00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:38.100
Someone

600
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:39.500
must have told them to do so.

601
00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:41.940
It seems

602
00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:42.540
that someone is trying to treat us

603
00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.140
the same way

604
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.420
they treated the former magistrates.

605
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:46.740
Since they want

606
00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.420
to send me a big gift,

607
00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:53.420
I should think about

608
00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.700
how to return the favor.

609
00:40:31.081 --> 00:40:36.071
â™ªSummer stars, autumn nightâ™ª

610
00:40:36.321 --> 00:40:41.441
â™ªWho is wandering
under the moon in my heartâ™ª

611
00:40:43.831 --> 00:40:48.771
â™ªThe deepest story
with the shallowest goodbyeâ™ª

612
00:40:49.101 --> 00:40:54.461
â™ªAfter passing by,
I can only meet you in my dreamâ™ª

613
00:40:56.651 --> 00:41:01.601
â™ªThe wind can't breeze
the long street of timeâ™ª

614
00:41:01.891 --> 00:41:07.081
â™ªThe burning yearning will never coolâ™ª

615
00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:14.361
â™ªTwo hearts meet again foreshadowing loveâ™ª

616
00:41:14.551 --> 00:41:20.901
â™ªHow can I describe it
when we look into each other's eyesâ™ª

617
00:41:22.091 --> 00:41:25.091
â™ªTake a life time to write the storyâ™ª

618
00:41:25.091 --> 00:41:26.871
â™ªTogether with youâ™ª

619
00:41:28.471 --> 00:41:29.851
â™ªCompany youâ™ª

620
00:41:29.851 --> 00:41:33.701
â™ªJust for your glance and smileâ™ª

621
00:41:33.701 --> 00:41:39.791
â™ªThe first promise means the forever loveâ™ª

622
00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:45.901
â™ªFireworks all over the sky
light up your nightâ™ª

623
00:41:46.451 --> 00:41:49.011
â™ªTake a life timeâ™ª

624
00:41:49.011 --> 00:41:52.961
â™ªTo write the story with you graduallyâ™ª

625
00:41:52.961 --> 00:41:55.341
â™ªJust like thisâ™ª

626
00:41:55.341 --> 00:41:59.181
â™ªOur love goes on and onâ™ª

627
00:41:59.181 --> 00:42:05.131
â™ªThe day we first met,
the year when we get oldâ™ª

628
00:42:05.551 --> 00:42:12.371
â™ªMy heart and my love will never vanishâ™ª

629
00:42:13.581 --> 00:42:22.001
â™ªMy heart and my love will never vanishâ™ª
