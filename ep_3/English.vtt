00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.980
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.290
Amazing, Yuxuan.

4
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.240
Awesome.

5
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.880
Yuxuan.

6
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.130
I have something
to discuss with you.

7
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.690
Dr. Li said that

8
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.490
if I did something

9
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.600
that I had done before,

10
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.210
it would help to
restore my memory.

11
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.930
I heard that

12
00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.850
I often

13
00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.770
watched you eat

14
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.600
at Kuixing Restaurant.

15
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600
I think

16
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.410
this is a good opportunity.

17
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.930
Maybe

18
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:03.650
if we go there again,

19
00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.850
I'll remember everything.

20
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.800
I officially inform you today that

21
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.600
I have made a reservation

22
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.200
at Kuixing Restaurant.

23
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.130
Come with me

24
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.010
in three days.

25
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.530
No.

26
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.370
Why?

27
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.810
Don't you ask me

28
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.480
to recover my memory?

29
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.410
Why won't you go now?

30
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.920
Why do I ask you
to get your memories back?

31
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.200
To let you turn back into

32
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.880
that provocative,

33
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.320
arrogant and domineering Nie Sangyu?

34
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.440
Now I am...

35
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.920
You're so dumb now.

36
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.010
I think it's fine.

37
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.600
Who is arrogant and domineering?

38
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.690
Who is dumb?

39
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:32.370
Who are you talking about?

40
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.760
Do you know how to respect people?

41
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.920
I haven't finished yet.

42
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.600
Ning Yuxuan, are you going or not?

43
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.160
No, I'm not.

44
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.410
You are not...

45
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.920
It doesn't work.

46
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.010
It doesn't

47
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.880
work...

48
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.640
Come with me.

49
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:06.600
How's the investigation going?

50
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.720
I've checked.

51
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.200
All the bandit gangs
that have been suppressed before

52
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.090
have indeed seen Lang.

53
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.760
But they know very little about

54
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.850
his background and whereabouts.

55
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.160
Except for the information disclosed
by the people in the government,

56
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.010
there is no more.

57
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.160
Keep checking.

58
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.530
Your Lordship,

59
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.200
the man

60
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.880
died in prison last night.

61
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.880
I have warned

62
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.760
the prison guards

63
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.370
to ensure the safety of others.

64
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.160
There won't be any more accidents.

65
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.160
Send someone to the South to check.

66
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.010
Yes, sir.

67
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.880
But

68
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.090
there are only a few people left

69
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.810
who are related to Lang.

70
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.970
Finding him with this little information

71
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.010
is like looking for a needle in the sea.

72
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.970
No matter it's looking for
a needle in the sea,

73
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.250
or digging three feet into the ground,

74
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.690
you must get him back to me.

75
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.090
Yes, sir.

76
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.410
Yuxuan.

77
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.480
Yuxuan,

78
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.810
before...

79
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.090
I was too willful before.

80
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.690
It's all my fault.

81
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.850
I apologize to you.

82
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.490
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:19.440
No need.

84
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.280
Don't say that.

85
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.130
I know it's all my fault.

86
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.690
I made this for you myself.

87
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.640
White fungus soup with lotus seeds.

88
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.400
Try it.

89
00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.350
(Gadgets, have a look.)

90
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.840
Are your arms tired?

91
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.640
Let me rub it for you.

92
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.930
This soup,

93
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.280
I spent all night making it.

94
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.930
I didn't sleep at all last night.

95
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.320
Are you sure you don't want to try it?

96
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.130
Do you forget that

97
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:07.760
I never drink

98
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.400
anything you make?

99
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.760
It's not a good idea to fight with him.

100
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.840
Bear it.

101
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.130
For 500 taels,

102
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.130
I can bear anything.

103
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.370
Bear it.

104
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:31.640
Bear it.

105
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.960
Yuxuan,

106
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.250
I'll tell you the truth.

107
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.760
The reason why I want you to go

108
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.690
is because...

109
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:45.520
I can't say it.

110
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.960
It is because there is a girl

111
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.840
who has been loving you so much

112
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.960
that she is very sick.

113
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.760
If she

114
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.730
doesn't see you now,

115
00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.570
it will be too late.

116
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.250
You really want me to go?

117
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.220
Go away!

118
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.880
Gui Bai,

119
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.760
within ten feet,

120
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.080
I don't want to see her.

121
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:19.440
Your Ladyship.

122
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.690
I...

123
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.520
Interesting.

124
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.570
Let's drink it ourselves.

125
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.930
Your Ladyship,

126
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.570
your soup is so delicious.

127
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:38.320
I'll make it for you next time.

128
00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.730
Ning Yuxuan
is not lucky enough to drink it.

129
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.280
Well,

130
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.840
he's really hard to deal with.

131
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.320
How can I get him
to Kuixing Restaurant?

132
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.250
Does he have any hobbies?

133
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.280
Hobbies?

134
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:51.760
Other than suppressing bandits,

135
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.080
he doesn't seem to have any hobbies.

136
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.730
So boring.

137
00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.880
Then does he care about anything?

138
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.520
Gui Bai.

139
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.880
He always takes Gui Bai
with him everywhere he goes.

140
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.130
Eat, suppress bandits
and go to the government office together.

141
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.760
They're inseparable every day.

142
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.760
Right.

143
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.730
Let's kidnap Gui Bai

144
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:10.760
to Kuixing Restaurant,

145
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.130
then he will go there.

146
00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.490
But Gui Bai is a strong fighter.

147
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.960
Can he be tied up by you?

148
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:17.690
That's right.

149
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:19.610
I forgot it.

150
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.490
Then how can he go?

151
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.960
There's nothing that

152
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.570
can impress him?

153
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.440
There is nothing he cares about?

154
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.810
The Emperor

155
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:34.320
gave him a ferghana horse before,

156
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.080
a tribute from the West.

157
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.840
He likes it quite a lot.

158
00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.640
What?

159
00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:45.080
Ferghana horse?

160
00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.250
(I've taken the horse away.)

161
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.840
(Meet me at Kuixing Restaurant.)

162
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.370
(Otherwise, I'll kill the horse and eat it.)

163
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:53.730
She thinks

164
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:54.960
she can threaten me with this?

165
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.170
Everyone knows

166
00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.320
you've never been threatened by anyone.

167
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.320
Why does Nie Sangyu

168
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.960
have to let me

169
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.280
go to Kuixing Restaurant?

170
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.930
Maybe she wants to make peace with you.

171
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:20.570
Your Lordship, where are you going?

172
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:21.320
Kuixing Restaurant.

173
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:22.640
Take the archers.

174
00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:25.010
Let's go now.

175
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:29.010
It's too much to deal with Her Ladyship.

176
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.160
So good.

177
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:36.800
Your Ladyship,

178
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.760
how can you be sure that

179
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.850
His Lordship will definitely come?

180
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.560
And

181
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.370
we took his horse.

182
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.250
This... This is too much of a game.

183
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.680
Think about it.

184
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.640
Given Ning Yuxuan's character,

185
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.970
I keep harassing him

186
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:49.850
again and again,

187
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:50.970
he must get tired of me.

188
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.560
I'm doing it

189
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:55.330
the other way round.

190
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.040
Mrs. Ning.

191
00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.880
Miss Gao, right?

192
00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:01.920
Miss Gao,

193
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.800
you are so elegant

194
00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.040
and generous.

195
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.280
You can spend 500 taels of silver

196
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.490
to charter such a large venue,

197
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.880
just for a meal.

198
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:09.370
Generous.

199
00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:10.400
Generous!

200
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.400
His Lordship is very handsome.

201
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.730
I've been in love with him for a long time.

202
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.880
Today's gathering

203
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.040
is just to share a good meal

204
00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.850
with His Lordship.

205
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.640
Don't be nervous.

206
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.520
When he comes,

207
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.520
just tell him

208
00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.010
you're my friend.

209
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:28.010
Okay?

210
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.160
Okay.

211
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.730
Hasn't His Lordship come yet?

212
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.680
He's here.

213
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.450
Yuxuan, you're here.

214
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:52.920
Miss Gao,

215
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:54.610
this is my husband.

216
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.210
Yuxuan, let me introduce.

217
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:56.970
This is Miss Gao

218
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.040
whom I told you before

219
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.160
that has been admiring you
for a long time.

220
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.610
Your Ladyship!

221
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:11.730
Your Ladyship!

222
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.490
I'm the one

223
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.920
who paid for having the meal
with Mr. Ning.

224
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:19.760
Thank you

225
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:20.880
Mrs. Ning.

226
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:23.850
I don't know...

227
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.400
I don't know who he is.

228
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.760
I didn't ask him to come here.

229
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.450
-I...
-You are Lang, right?

230
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.490
Why don't you dare
to show your true face?

231
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:39.250
Cut the crap.

232
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.800
Catch Lackey Ning!

233
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.370
Go!

234
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:58.520
Ning Yuxuan came prepared.

235
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.800
Gui Bai.

236
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:16.090
Your Lordship.

237
00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.680
Gui Bai.

238
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:23.520
I want him alive.

239
00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.090
Yes.

240
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.680
We can go now.

241
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.490
Go.

242
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.040
Go, go, go.

243
00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.010
Go, go, go, go.

244
00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:31.920
Your Ladyship, let's go.

245
00:11:41.090 --> 00:11:41.880
Lackey Ning,

246
00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.640
let your men put down the arrows.

247
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.800
Put them down!

248
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:48.970
Your Ladyship!

249
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.090
Ning Yuxuan,

250
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.330
save me.

251
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:01.560
Ning Yuxuan, save me!

252
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.130
Save me, save me.

253
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:05.850
Ning...

254
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.250
What?

255
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.250
Don't you even care about

256
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.130
your wife's life?

257
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.760
Cut the crap!

258
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.680
Ning Yuxuan!

259
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:25.560
Save me!

260
00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.210
This woman is domineering.

261
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.160
She's turned my mansion upside down.

262
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.490
If you kill her,

263
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.250
I will thank you.

264
00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:35.400
You...

265
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.610
Ning Yuxuan,

266
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:37.370
it's not the time

267
00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:38.450
to joke now.

268
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.400
My life is at stake,

269
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.160
don't joke about it.

270
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.090
Save me!

271
00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:41.370
Hurry up.

272
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.490
Have you ever

273
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.640
seen me joke around?

274
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.880
No matter what the cost,

275
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.730
you will not escape today.

276
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.040
Your Ladyship.

277
00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.010
Are you serious?

278
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.090
Marquis Moyu, you deserve your name.

279
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.010
So cruel.

280
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.920
To achieve your goal,
you could even kill your wife.

281
00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.970
You can try it if you don't believe me.

282
00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:37.640
Your Ladyship.

283
00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.490
Your Ladyship.

284
00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:51.210
Arrest her.

285
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.370
The rest of you,

286
00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.760
chase him!

287
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:11.700
(Hongta Temple)

288
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.210
There's no way ahead.

289
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:15.760
They should be inside.

290
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:16.730
Get in and search.

291
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.100
(Grand Hall)

292
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:24.730
The government soldiers are here.

293
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:27.160
This...

294
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:33.210
Sir.

295
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.920
They are not in any other place

296
00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:35.800
except the Scripture Repository
in the temple.

297
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.760
Scripture Repository?

298
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.370
Yes.

299
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:39.450
Lead the way.

300
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:44.180
(Scripture Repository)

301
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.280
Amitabha Buddha.

302
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.680
Master, please stop.

303
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.610
Master Liao Ran.

304
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.210
Please forgive me.

305
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:58.490
This is our temple's Scripture Repository.

306
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.160
No one who is
not a disciple of our temple

307
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.970
is allowed to enter.

308
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:02.920
I know

309
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.090
the rules of the temple.

310
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.130
But a group of bandits

311
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.160
have just sneaked into the temple.

312
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.520
For your safety,

313
00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.730
please do me a favor.

314
00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:10.850
Stop.

315
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:13.730
Scripture Repository is
an important place in our temple.

316
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.090
It is guarded by the monks on duty.

317
00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:17.760
We have not seen any bandits.

318
00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.850
Master,

319
00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.010
please go search elsewhere.

320
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.280
Okay.

321
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.880
I'll go search elsewhere.

322
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.760
Ning Yuxuan!

323
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.420
(Tao Siwei)

324
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:51.040
Siwei?

325
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.090
You bring so many people this time.

326
00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:54.850
I know your character

327
00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:55.800
very well.

328
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.400
Let's talk in private.

329
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.850
I was patrolling the streets

330
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.760
and saw you chasing
the killer from the restaurant.

331
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.850
Luckily I got there in time.

332
00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:12.970
Otherwise,

333
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.370
you'll be in big trouble.

334
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:17.520
Do you know what this place is?

335
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.880
Hongta Temple is a royal temple.

336
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.490
Trespassing

337
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.010
is a crime of death.

338
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.330
Since it's a royal temple,

339
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.730
then I can't let the remaining members
of the Tea Gang

340
00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:26.730
do anything wrong here.

341
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.970
Suppressing bandits is a national matter,

342
00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:29.490
not your family matter.

343
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.160
Yuxuan,

344
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:33.210
you are the enemy of the Tea Gang,

345
00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:35.250
but you are also the Left Consul.

346
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.850
Don't be impulsive.

347
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:39.010
That's enough.

348
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:39.970
Let's go back together.

349
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.800
Save yourself the trouble
of getting caught.

350
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.010
That Consul Ling

351
00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:44.800
is waiting to get the goods on you.

352
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.370
I'll wait for you at the door.

353
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.330
Let's go.

354
00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:07.170
Master Liao Ran,

355
00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:10.730
sorry to bother you.

356
00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.890
Amitabha Buddha.

357
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.280
Be good.

358
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:30.490
Gui Bai,

359
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.080
get some fresh-faced men

360
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.210
to keep an eye on the surroundings.

361
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:34.800
Yes, sir.

362
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.020
(Buddha's Light Shines)

363
00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:49.840
(Lang,)

364
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:50.690
(what are you looking for?)

365
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.490
I'm going to see

366
00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.600
my little sister of my godfather.

367
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.520
(Yuan Lang (Junior))
Of course I have to give a congratulatory gift.

368
00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:56.170
Dad,

369
00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.560
how about this pair of jade pendants?

370
00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.700
(Yuan Dingshan)

371
00:17:59.210 --> 00:17:59.970
Good.

372
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.210
Full moon and reunion.

373
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.250
Very good symbolism.

374
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.730
Give this one.

375
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:09.280
Lang,

376
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.650
the scouting guards

377
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.170
all left at night.

378
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:15.970
After a while,

379
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:16.840
you can follow

380
00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.560
the carriages that deliver the food

381
00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.650
and get down the mountain safely.

382
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.650
Thank you, Uncle.

383
00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.690
Thank you, Master Liao Ran.

384
00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.520
It's been so long since then.

385
00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:38.890
Let go of what you should let go of.

386
00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:42.080
There are still doubts
about what happened back then.

387
00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:43.360
I think...

388
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.320
There are no doubts.

389
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.890
Who are they

390
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:47.730
to kill

391
00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.120
all of us?

392
00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:50.690
But your father

393
00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.730
and Ning Zhongtian

394
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.520
have already died together.

395
00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:55.970
Why do you have to

396
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.760
seek revenge on his son?

397
00:18:57.890 --> 00:19:01.170
When will this revenge be over?

398
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.410
Lang,

399
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.210
you should have your own life.

400
00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:06.120
Life?

401
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.800
For 18 years,

402
00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.600
the only goal of my life

403
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.320
has been revenge.

404
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.600
So is Ning Yuxuan.

405
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.410
He has never stopped suppressing bandits

406
00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.040
for so many years,

407
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.320
with the goal of killing

408
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.840
all the men of the Tea Gang.

409
00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:25.650
There must be an end

410
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:28.650
between me and him.

411
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.730
I sent you to Jixia Mountain

412
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.800
to grind your temperament

413
00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.040
to not be impulsive like your father's.

414
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.690
But now your temperament

415
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.120
is still exactly the same as your father's.

416
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.120
Don't persuade others to be good

417
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.320
without their suffering.

418
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.120
Since 18 years

419
00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.120
can't heal the pain in your heart,

420
00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.760
anything else I say

421
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.490
won't help.

422
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.280
Forget it.

423
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.280
Do whatever

424
00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:08.930
you want to do.

425
00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:12.730
When did you and that Lang

426
00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.730
hook up?

427
00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:15.340
I've told you

428
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.690
many times.

429
00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.080
I don't even know the man

430
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.410
you're talking about.

431
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.280
I did that just because

432
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.280
someone is willing to spend 500 taels

433
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.170
to have a meal with you...

434
00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:24.600
To have a meal with you, so...

435
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.080
I thought it was that Miss Gao.

436
00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:29.520
I...

437
00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:30.730
I led you

438
00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:31.760
into danger.

439
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.690
It's my fault.

440
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.120
I apologize to you.

441
00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.560
But today,

442
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.760
at the critical moment,

443
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.040
you didn't care about my life either.

444
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:40.650
Right?

445
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:42.890
Then let's

446
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:43.800
call this matter even.

447
00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.560
At the wedding banquet,

448
00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.250
you and that man
almost appeared at the same time

449
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:50.320
to assassinate me.

450
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.360
Today's banquet at Kuixing Restaurant,

451
00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.650
you lured me into the game.

452
00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:58.250
Two coincidences.

453
00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.690
Can you call it even
simply by saying you want money?

454
00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.490
I told you I don't know that man.

455
00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.890
Then why did he take the arrow for you?

456
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:04.650
I don't know.

457
00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:05.800
I don't know him.

458
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.520
How many times do you want me to say it?

459
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.450
I'll ask you one last time.

460
00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.490
What is

461
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.520
your relationship with him?

462
00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.210
I'll tell you one last time.

463
00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:27.890
I have nothing

464
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.520
to do with him!

465
00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.760
I don't know him!

466
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:36.280
Gui Bai.

467
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.040
Your Lordship.

468
00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:42.560
This is Her Ladyship.

469
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.800
That is too...

470
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.650
Bring it up!

471
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:51.800
What are you doing?

472
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:53.410
You made it

473
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:54.280
yourself.

474
00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.970
It's coming in handy today.

475
00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:04.690
If you confess now,

476
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.890
you can save yourself from the pain.

477
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:17.040
Ning Yuxuan,

478
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:20.320
since you don't believe

479
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.280
anything I say,

480
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.690
why are you asking me?

481
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.280
I'm not scaring you.

482
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.690
Your Lordship.

483
00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:37.080
I heard that you were assassinated.

484
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.320
I'm so worried.

485
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:39.560
Are you all right?

486
00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.080
Sangyu, what happened to you?

487
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.320
Is it...

488
00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:51.840
Your Lordship,

489
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.450
Her Ladyship has always been virtuous.

490
00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:54.490
It is definitely not...

491
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:55.690
Go back to your room!

492
00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.800
I'm just worried about your safety.

493
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:03.410
Please go on.

494
00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.690
I'll give you

495
00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.490
half an hour.

496
00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:24.930
Think about

497
00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:27.690
what you should say.

498
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.280
I didn't! I didn't!

499
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.040
Even if you hit me,

500
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.450
I didn't.

501
00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.360
Your Ladyship,

502
00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:41.760
His Lordship is...

503
00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:51.760
I just didn't.

504
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.730
Why don't you believe me?

505
00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.010
Your Lordship,

506
00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:04.840
are you really going to whip your wife?

507
00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:08.250
What do you think?

508
00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:10.970
I...

509
00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.120
I don't know.

510
00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.490
How could I

511
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:15.730
lynch a woman?

512
00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.170
I just feel that

513
00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:20.080
just now,

514
00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:21.250
you did seem very angry.

515
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.970
Two accidents caused by Nie Sangyu

516
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.040
were both related to Lang.

517
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.970
Of course I have doubts.

518
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:30.730
But after that test just now,

519
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:33.650
it seems that it is just a coincidence.

520
00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.250
Miss Wen suddenly appeared,

521
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:38.120
so I had to come back first.

522
00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.520
Judging by Her Ladyship's resolute look,

523
00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.560
it seems that
she really doesn't know anything.

524
00:24:46.410 --> 00:24:47.730
Find Lang as soon as possible.

525
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.930
Then we can find out the truth.

526
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:53.320
What about Her Ladyship?

527
00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.930
Let her stay in the courtyard

528
00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.010
alone for a while.

529
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.650
Then send her back to Reflection Pavilion.

530
00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:04.360
Yes.

531
00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.560
Miss Wen.

532
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:14.800
Nanny Wang,

533
00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:16.360
His Lordship has just said that

534
00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.120
if Her Ladyship does not confess

535
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.520
within half an hour,

536
00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.970
she will be flogged.

537
00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:22.890
Didn't you hear that?

538
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.730
I heard that.

539
00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:25.690
But,

540
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:28.080
after all,
His Lordship hasn't returned yet.

541
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.360
I am just a servant,

542
00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.840
she is the First Lady after all.

543
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.120
Nanny Wang,

544
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.410
if you do

545
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.080
what His Lordship asked to do,

546
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.320
wouldn't it be a great merit?

547
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.280
Your Ladyship,

548
00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.840
time ran out.

549
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.210
Confess all the evil things

550
00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:05.930
you have done.

551
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.450
Save yourself the pain and suffering.

552
00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.970
Why should I confess

553
00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.600
what I didn't do?

554
00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:17.650
I work for His Lordship.

555
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.890
Sorry to offend.

556
00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:22.730
What are you doing?

557
00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.120
Help!

558
00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:25.210
Help!

559
00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:27.120
Help!

560
00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.250
What are you doing?

561
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.520
What are you doing?

562
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:30.730
Your Ladyship,

563
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.320
sorry to offend.

564
00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:34.560
Let go of me! Help!

565
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.930
Help!

566
00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:39.120
You'd better confess.

567
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:39.840
Let go of me!

568
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.360
Let go of me!

569
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:42.800
Help!

570
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.650
You still don't say anything?

571
00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.040
I don't know anything.

572
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.210
I don't know

573
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:52.210
anything.

574
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.650
Will you confess or not?

575
00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.010
Just confess.

576
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:02.120
I'll say.

577
00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.970
You ruthless villain...

578
00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.760
What are you doing?

579
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.080
I am

580
00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:18.970
following your orders.

581
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:20.800
After half an hour,

582
00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.600
punish Her Ladyship.

583
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.250
I... I am

584
00:27:24.450 --> 00:27:28.080
doing... doing it for you.

585
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.330
Go away!

586
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.520
Take Her Ladyship to Reflection Pavilion.

587
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.120
Gui Bai,

588
00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:55.890
go find a doctor.

589
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:56.890
Yes, sir.

590
00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.600
Your Lordship.

591
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:02.730
How is she?

592
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.690
The doctor has given her medicine.

593
00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.600
He said her flesh wound was heavy,

594
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:08.320
but the good news is that
it didn't hurt her root.

595
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.730
She just needs to rest for a while.

596
00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:13.560
Have you investigated?

597
00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:16.250
I've had someone look into it.

598
00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.410
Someone else

599
00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.690
is behind her.

600
00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:24.010
Wen Wan?

601
00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:25.520
Yes.

602
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:33.650
Wen Wan was stabbed by Nie Sangyu

603
00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:34.760
at the wedding.

604
00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.760
She did it

605
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.760
to get back at her.

606
00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:39.760
She also confessed

607
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.650
another thing.

608
00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.250
Say it.

609
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:43.040
Miss Wen's wedding injury

610
00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:45.040
has another hidden agenda.

611
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.840
On the day of the wedding...

612
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.010
Miss Wen held Her Ladyship's wrist

613
00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:16.650
and stabbed herself.

614
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:31.490
So

615
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:32.760
it was herself.

616
00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.010
Are you sure?

617
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.040
I've confirmed it many times.

618
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:39.760
Nanny Wang confessed this

619
00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:40.760
to reduce her guilt.

620
00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.650
With my interrogation experience,

621
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:43.800
it doesn't look like a lie.

622
00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.560
They two are really...

623
00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.760
With Nie Sangyu's temper,

624
00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.080
if it is true,

625
00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:57.560
it will cause a big storm.

626
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.840
Take this whipping

627
00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.490
as my order.

628
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.560
I hope this is over.

629
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.040
Aren't you afraid that

630
00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.450
Her Ladyship
will hold a grudge against you?

631
00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:17.120
There are

632
00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.210
more than one grudge between us.

633
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.560
So I'm not afraid of another one.

634
00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.010
Muxu,

635
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.250
in this mansion,

636
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:02.520
only you are willing to be kind to me.

637
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.250
(Nie Sangyu.)

638
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.520
(Your crime of disturbing)

639
00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.250
(the Ning's Mansion is unforgivable.)

640
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:17.930
(Thanks to Her Ladyship.)

641
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.840
(Plum blossom mark.)

642
00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.890
(My body)

643
00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:25.080
(was ruined by you.)

644
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.760
(So I felt resentful.)

645
00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:33.280
Everyone doesn't like me.

646
00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.840
Ning Yuxuan even shot me with arrows

647
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:45.930
and ordered to whip me.

648
00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.650
Am I that annoying?

649
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.210
No matter what I do,

650
00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.650
people won't forgive me.

651
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.320
Then why do I

652
00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.650
still stay here?

653
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:16.170
Why can't I do anything right?

654
00:33:39.930 --> 00:33:40.560
Tao.

655
00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:42.520
(Qin Yixian)
According to reliable information,

656
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:43.930
my brother Ning

657
00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.080
whipped Her Ladyship

658
00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:45.800
last night.

659
00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.010
Her Ladyship's life

660
00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:49.120
is uncertain now.

661
00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:50.600
Qin Yixian,

662
00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.410
don't talk nonsense.

663
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.320
I only heard a rumor.

664
00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.650
What's the matter with you?

665
00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:06.690
(Yuxuan,)

666
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:08.200
we are not spreading gossip.

667
00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:09.600
There are no impermeable walls

668
00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.490
in this capital.

669
00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:12.490
If anything happens to your mansion,

670
00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:14.200
it will be widely spread among the people.

671
00:34:14.490 --> 00:34:16.040
I know about Her Ladyship,

672
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.370
she couldn't

673
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:18.200
do anything harmful to you.

674
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.160
You two don't need to work?

675
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.010
So free?

676
00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.040
You are...

677
00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:25.930
Off-topic, off-topic.

678
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:27.370
Yuxuan,

679
00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:29.490
in fact, we're here today

680
00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:30.520
to persuade you.

681
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:33.070
Your relationship with Ling Jianxing

682
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:33.970
is tense now.

683
00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:34.970
General Nie is the most popular person

684
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:36.330
in front of the Emperor.

685
00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:38.240
If something happens to Her Ladyship,

686
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:39.810
your future will be in jeopardy.

687
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:42.850
This bottle of sore medicine

688
00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:44.080
is for Her Ladyship.

689
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:45.010
In the future,

690
00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.120
if you dare to do it again...

691
00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:47.040
Ning Yuxuan!

692
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:03.560
Be careful.

693
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:04.970
Why are you here?

694
00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.930
Why am I here?

695
00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:13.080
Muxu, give me a hand.

696
00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.600
Here, Your Ladyship.

697
00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.660
(Letter of divorcement)

698
00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.010
Read it yourself.

699
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:30.810
Muxu,

700
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.330
pick it up.

701
00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:33.490
Send it over.

702
00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:34.600
Send it over.

703
00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:36.330
Hurry up.

704
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:37.770
I...

705
00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:39.810
Take it.

706
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.120
Read it carefully.

707
00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.330
Letter of divorcement?

708
00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:53.330
Yes.

709
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:55.520
I want to divorce you.

710
00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:56.930
I'm here today

711
00:35:56.930 --> 00:35:58.120
(Letter of divorcement)
to officially inform you.

712
00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:58.810
Ning Yuxuan,

713
00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.370
from today onwards,

714
00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.970
the First Lady of Ning's Mansion

715
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:03.120
will be whoever she wants to be.

716
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.410
I won't be it anymore.

717
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.040
So from tomorrow,

718
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.770
I will officially leave the mansion.

719
00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:10.160
I want to divorce you.

720
00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:11.680
Divorce me?

721
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:12.370
Yes.

722
00:36:12.810 --> 00:36:13.520
Don't you understand?

723
00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:14.930
Or can't you read?

724
00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:16.720
It's clearly written there.

725
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.560
Look, look.

726
00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:18.080
Look.

727
00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:19.930
Since ancient times,

728
00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:21.040
only husbands have the right
to divorce their wives.

729
00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.330
I've never heard that

730
00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:23.330
women can divorce their husbands.

731
00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:24.810
What do you mean?

732
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.240
Shouldn't a man

733
00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.600
bear the consequences of his mistakes?

734
00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:30.490
Her Ladyship has a point.

735
00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.330
Mistakes make no distinction
between men and women, or classes.

736
00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.450
Whoever

737
00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:34.450
makes a mistake

738
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.490
should be brave enough to admit it.

739
00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:38.600
Hey,

740
00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.160
you have the right idea.

741
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.890
Although we have never met before,

742
00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:42.890
you must be a good person

743
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:44.240
who knows right from wrong.

744
00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:47.770
Hey?

745
00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:49.200
What? I...

746
00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.520
Don't you recognize me?

747
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:52.520
No.

748
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.290
Sangyu, it's me.

749
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:55.770
Tao Siwei.

750
00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.450
Have you forgotten me?

751
00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.010
Her Ladyship has lost her memory.

752
00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.010
Lost her memory?

753
00:37:03.370 --> 00:37:04.240
You've lost your memory?

754
00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:05.520
How could that be?

755
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.930
How could you lose your memory?

756
00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:08.200
I don't believe it.

757
00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:09.450
You two go out first.

758
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:10.560
No.

759
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.640
You just got whipped.

760
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.770
How could you lose your memory?

761
00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:13.640
Impossible. I don't believe it.

762
00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.200
You two go out first.

763
00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:16.560
Stop it.

764
00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:17.560
I'm Tao Siwei.

765
00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:18.850
Are you playing dumb with me?

766
00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.520
Tao, let's go.

767
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.330
I have medicine for sores.

768
00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:22.490
Use it for yourself.

769
00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.520
I brought it for you.

770
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:24.040
You must use it.

771
00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:24.560
Stop it, let's go.

772
00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:25.370
Medicine for sores.

773
00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:26.770
How can she lose her memory?

774
00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:27.410
Impossible.

775
00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:28.970
They are...

776
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:29.810
Nie Sangyu,

777
00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.450
I'm the Marquis.

778
00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:33.890
All my marriages

779
00:37:33.890 --> 00:37:35.160
are ordered by the Emperor.

780
00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.080
If you want to leave the Ning's Mansion,

781
00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.720
go talk to the Emperor.

782
00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.490
I'm scared.

783
00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:42.720
Are you using the Emperor to pressure me?

784
00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.160
I tell you.

785
00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.410
I don't care about it.

786
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:47.240
When the knife was on my neck,

787
00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:48.080
did you ever care about me?

788
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.930
Did you ever think of our old love?

789
00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:50.720
Old love?

790
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.200
I just think of the old love,

791
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.330
so I indulge you

792
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:54.680
again and again.

793
00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:57.770
Muxu,

794
00:37:57.770 --> 00:37:58.850
listen, how funny he is!

795
00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:00.040
What nonsense.

796
00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:01.490
Whipping me

797
00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:02.770
is condoning me?

798
00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.560
Are you out of your mind?

799
00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.160
I...

800
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:11.890
Take this whipping

801
00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:14.120
as a warning to you.

802
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:15.490
If you have anything to say,

803
00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.240
wait until you get better.

804
00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.290
I can't get well here.

805
00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:20.720
No one treats me like a good person here.

806
00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:21.890
I told you

807
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.160
I don't remember any of those things.

808
00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:23.970
I didn't do it.

809
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:24.770
Does anyone believe me?

810
00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:25.640
Do you believe me?

811
00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:26.930
Now,

812
00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:27.850
there's no trust

813
00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:29.040
between you and me.

814
00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:29.600
Then why are you

815
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:30.680
keeping me here?

816
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:31.770
I'm going to leave!

817
00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:32.770
I tell you, Ning Yuxuan.

818
00:38:32.770 --> 00:38:34.040
No matter what,

819
00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:34.930
I'm going to leave today.

820
00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:35.770
I'm going to divorce you.

821
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:37.290
I'm going to leave...

822
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.810
Leave the Marquis's Mansion.

823
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.330
Who told you to carry

824
00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:45.240
her here?

825
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:46.560
It's... it's Her Ladyship.

826
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:56.810
Carry her back to Reflection Pavilion.

827
00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.600
-Yes.
- Yes.

828
00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.560
When you get your memory back,

829
00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.970
then come back to tell me this.

830
00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:02.810
Put me down first. Put me down.

831
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:03.890
Put me down first. I'm not leaving.

832
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:04.490
Put me down first.

833
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.770
Your Ladyship.

834
00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:05.490
Ning Yuxuan.

835
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.640
I tell you,

836
00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.370
I can deal with you today.

837
00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:09.080
I tell you,

838
00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.200
I'm going to leave here.

839
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:11.490
No matter what people say.

840
00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:13.010
(Letter of divorcement)
You are not qualified...

841
00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.080
To bargain with me.

842
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.330
(Be careful!)

843
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:27.410
Don't move.

844
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:28.410
Muxu, come here.

845
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:31.200
You said my father is General Zhenyuan,

846
00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:31.640
right?

847
00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:32.680
Okay.

848
00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.080
Pack the things.

849
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:34.850
Let's leave at dark.

850
00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:35.640
I want to leave here.

851
00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.640
You're going to take me to find him.

852
00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:37.970
Back to your original home?

853
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:38.330
Yes.

854
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:40.120
But it's a bit far.

855
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.040
How far is it?

856
00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:42.680
It's so far.

857
00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.370
General Nie spent many years

858
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:44.600
in the Northwest to guard.

859
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:45.370
Then your family

860
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:46.560
moved to the Northwest.

861
00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.290
The Northwest?

862
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:50.970
Besides,

863
00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:52.450
after you married His Lordship,

864
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.240
your relationship with the old general

865
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.680
has become much more tense.

866
00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:58.490
There is such a thing?

867
00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:01.560
But don't worry.

868
00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:02.450
In the past few years,

869
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:03.520
the old lady and your sister

870
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.410
have coordinated.

871
00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:05.720
Your relationship with the old general

872
00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.010
has eased a lot.

873
00:40:09.330 --> 00:40:11.010
This Ning Yuxuan

874
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.370
has caused a lot of disturbance in my family.

875
00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:18.330
Your Ladyship.

876
00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:19.930
How could I be so blind

877
00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:21.640
as to fall for him?

878
00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.850
Don't think so.

879
00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:23.890
Perhaps,

880
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:25.490
this... this is all a misunderstanding.

881
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:26.810
Yesterday, Gui Bai invited

882
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:28.040
the best doctor in the capital

883
00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.240
to treat your wound.

884
00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:30.520
Misunderstanding?

885
00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:32.640
Misunderstanding?

886
00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:34.120
He gave me a whip

887
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:34.970
and found me a doctor,

888
00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:35.970
then should I thank him?

889
00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:37.450
I tell you,

890
00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:38.120
I don't want to stay here

891
00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.240
for a minute now.

892
00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.160
Well, if we leave,

893
00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.200
where are we going?

894
00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:45.080
The money we have on us

895
00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.970
is not even enough
to pay the rent for one night.

896
00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:48.520
Pay...

897
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:50.450
Even if I can't afford it, I have to go!

898
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.930
I tell you, Muxu,

899
00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:53.560
no matter how much I loved him before,

900
00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.680
from now on,

901
00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.240
like the well water
does not intrude river water,

902
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.720
(I'm at odds with him!)

903
00:40:58.290 --> 00:40:59.600
(Your Ladyship, keep your voice down.)

904
00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:01.680
Muxu,

905
00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:03.930
how many days

906
00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:06.240
can I heal from this wound?

907
00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:06.890
The doctor said

908
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:08.240
it would take at least seven more days.

909
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:10.160
Seven days?

910
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:14.930
Okay.

911
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.770
Just seven days.

912
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:19.560
During these seven days, I'll make money

913
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.720
even if I'm lying down.

914
00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.720
Then I'll swagger away

915
00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.160
from the Ning's Mansion!

916
00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:27.370
Hurry up.

917
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.200
Give me a hand.

918
00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.290
It hurts, right?

919
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.410
I heard a few words

920
00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:33.680
at the door during the day

921
00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:35.520
when I was getting
a doctor for Her Ladyship.

922
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.450
According to the evidence I've found now

923
00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:39.450
and Her Ladyship's words,

924
00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.200
she may really just want to earn money.

925
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:45.720
What did she say?

926
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.370
I...

927
00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:52.850
It's not convenient to say.

928
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:54.720
Nothing inconvenient. Just say it.

929
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.490
This Ning Yuxuan

930
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.080
has caused a lot of disturbance in my family.

931
00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.680
How could I be so blind

932
00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.890
as to fall for him?

933
00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:07.490
That's what Her Ladyship said,

934
00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.290
not me.

935
00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:12.240
What else did she say?

936
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:14.640
Would you

937
00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.600
like to hear that?

938
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.450
Yes.

939
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.240
Just seven days.

940
00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.490
During these seven days, I'll make money

941
00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:24.330
even if I'm lying down.

942
00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:25.560
Then I'll swagger away

943
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.680
from the Ning's Mansion!

944
00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:29.010
Leave the Ning's Mansion.

945
00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:33.680
Make money even if she's lying down.

946
00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:36.810
Gui Bai,

947
00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.930
are you sure the person
you fished out that day

948
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:41.290
was Nie Sangyu?
