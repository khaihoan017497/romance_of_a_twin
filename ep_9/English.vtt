00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.980
=Episode 9=

3
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.520
In this case,

4
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.490
I bet His Majesty
sends Ning Yuxuan to Haifang

5
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.850
because he's after something else.

6
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.650
Muxu,

7
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.320
when will he be back?

8
00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.930
Tomorrow noontime.

9
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.650
He'll be back tomorrow?

10
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.010
Great. Perfect.

11
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.440
He's been through hell

12
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.800
in jail these days.

13
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:08.880
We'll prepare a nice

14
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.090
homecoming party for him tomorrow.

15
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.530
Finally, he's coming home.

16
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.460
(Ning's Mansion)

17
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.410
Second Lady,

18
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.370
His Lordship should be home by now,
shouldn't he?

19
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.480
Right. It's about time.

20
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.200
Yeah.

21
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.290
Let's wait a bit longer.

22
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.810
There he is.

23
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.970
You are all here.

24
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.880
Your Lordship,
it mustn't be easy for you.

25
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.200
You've even lost weight.

26
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.290
You're home at last.

27
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.530
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

28
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.880
You wish to see Her Ladyship,
don't you?

29
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.570
Make way.

30
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.970
Be careful.

31
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.970
Make way. Make way.

32
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.320
Watch out. Watch out.

33
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.480
- Watch out.
- Be careful.

34
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.200
You're home, Ning Yuxuan.

35
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.850
Nie Sangyu,

36
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.530
what are you doing?

37
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.290
This is the homecoming ceremony

38
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.690
that I prepared for you.

39
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.090
You want me to step across the brazier?

40
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.010
I know

41
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.970
that it hasn't been easy for you

42
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.200
in jail in the past days,

43
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.320
so today,

44
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.850
you will step across the brazier

45
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.880
full of burning willow branches

46
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.200
to expunge your bad luck.

47
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.130
Take it away.

48
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.010
What?

49
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.760
I ask you to take it away.

50
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.600
Listen,

51
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.640
don't feel embarrassed.

52
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.200
It will burn out soon,

53
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.200
and it won't work.

54
00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.640
Come on.

55
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.810
Thank you very much.

56
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.370
Hey.

57
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.160
You are supposed to step across it.

58
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.760
Weird.

59
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.610
Close the door.

60
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.610
She's unbelievable.

61
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.370
I heard that she did some good things

62
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.010
when I was in jail.

63
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.640
But as soon as I'm home,

64
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.170
she starts to do crazy stuff again.

65
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.610
I…

66
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.050
Your Lordship,

67
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.840
you may have got her wrong.

68
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.370
Look at the basin full of water

69
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.280
with grapefruit leaves in it,

70
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.050
I bet she went to the market

71
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.880
to buy the freshest leaves

72
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.400
specifically for you.

73
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.490
In my opinion,

74
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:45.880
she's serious about dispelling

75
00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.080
bad luck from you.

76
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.280
What grapefruit leaves?

77
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.960
Grapefruit leaves and brazier-crossing?

78
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.810
I don't believe they will do anything.

79
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.170
Superstitious stuff.

80
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.490
Out you go.

81
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:18.760
I need to rest.

82
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.760
Yes.

83
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.050
I wonder

84
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.760
what else

85
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.440
Nie Sangyu

86
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.640
put in the basin.

87
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.930
Grapefruit leaves.

88
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.730
Stepping across a brazier.

89
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.370
Unbelievable.

90
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:22.690
It is strange enough

91
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:23.960
that the Tea Gang appeared in Haifang.

92
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.130
And now that Ning Yuxuan

93
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.520
was demoted and sent to Haifang,

94
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.730
I have every reason to go there.

95
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.250
I see you have made up your mind,

96
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.050
so I won't waste my breath anymore.

97
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.640
Be careful during your journey.

98
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.880
Uncle,

99
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.280
take care.

100
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.880
Amitabha.

101
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.370
The priggish scholars
were supposed to be dealt with,

102
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.370
but it got delayed

103
00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:13.400
because I was put in jail.

104
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.400
It has to be taken care of before we go.

105
00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:15.810
Yes.

106
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.250
You were freed

107
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.840
because Her Ladyship

108
00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.050
built up your reputation

109
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.730
through the priggish scholars.

110
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.050
Someone's poison

111
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.250
can be others' medicine.

112
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.400
Every person is to be handled
with different strategy.

113
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:29.760
No sweeping generalization.

114
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:30.690
Understood.

115
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.080
Your Lordship,

116
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.080
we are to go to Haifang

117
00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.250
in a rush.

118
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.520
Will you go on your own

119
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.960
or…

120
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.370
Nie Sangyu offended Ling Jianxing,

121
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.050
thus the incident of priggish scholars arose.

122
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:53.810
It concerns me

123
00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.250
that she's kept in the capital.

124
00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:01.440
I'll think about it.

125
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.520
Ning Yuxuan.

126
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:13.570
What's the matter?

127
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.760
Why did you refuse
to step across the brazier?

128
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.050
You just got out of jail.

129
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.690
You are to step across a brazier

130
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.610
with burning willow branches in it

131
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.170
for your bad luck

132
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.760
to be dispelled.

133
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.730
I have never

134
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.400
been a superstitious person.

135
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.880
Ugh, what a waste of my breath.

136
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.690
Wait.

137
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:30.280
What?

138
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.570
You will follow me

139
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.280
to Haifang.

140
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.210
You want me to go with you?

141
00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.520
No.

142
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:41.280
I'm planning to open up a shop
in the capital.

143
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:41.640
I…

144
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.130
Your Lordship.

145
00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:49.680
Miss Wen, what's up?

146
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.450
I wanted to see you.

147
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.090
Good to see you, Your Ladyship.

148
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.640
Miss Wen.

149
00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:58.680
You must have

150
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.450
gone through a lot, Your Lordship.

151
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.010
Your sacrifice for the nation

152
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.800
shall be noted by His Majesty.

153
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.450
I'm sure

154
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.640
you'll be reinstated someday.

155
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.450
What is the matter?

156
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.450
I have heard that it is
hot and humid in Haifang.

157
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.520
I'm worried

158
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.250
that you won't get used to the weather.

159
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:16.330
So I suggest

160
00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.210
you take me with you.

161
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:19.800
I can at least cook something

162
00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:22.040
that you like to eat.

163
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.370
Yeah,

164
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.970
you can take Miss Wen away with you.

165
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:27.800
I'll pass…

166
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:28.520
Thanks but no.

167
00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.520
I don't care for food.

168
00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:34.490
Your Lordship,

169
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.490
I have heard that many people
do business in Haifang,

170
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.130
and there are so many novelties.

171
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.330
I'd like to go shopping.

172
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.560
And I've also been told

173
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.250
that they sell all kinds of snacks

174
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:46.850
that are all delicious,

175
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:48.850
and they are not available
in the capital.

176
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.680
How I wish to try some!

177
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:54.560
Really?

178
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.970
Many people do business in Haifang

179
00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:58.520
and

180
00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.800
they sell all sorts of novelties?

181
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.800
Yeah.

182
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:09.520
Miss Wen,

183
00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:10.280
how about

184
00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:11.520
I go with you?

185
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:12.680
So that you won't be bored

186
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.680
on the way.

187
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.610
Good.

188
00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.090
You can take me with you,

189
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.160
so I can look after His Lordship

190
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:20.850
and accompany you, Your Ladyship.

191
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:21.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.370
I will go pack my belongings.

193
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.610
Good night.

194
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:29.280
Why are you standing still?

195
00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:30.640
Go pack your things.

196
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.560
Do you not know

197
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:44.640
how you got out of jail?

198
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:45.280
Do you not know

199
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:46.450
who spread

200
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:47.610
your reputation for you?

201
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.250
I invested so much effort!

202
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.330
Quickly.

203
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.490
What?

204
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.760
I don't have any money now.

205
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:13.760
Take it.

206
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.610
I hope it's worth my while.

207
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:20.850
So much.

208
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:21.490
It's my payment to you

209
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:22.850
for saving my reputation.

210
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.560
Too much?

211
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:25.450
Give it back to me then.

212
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.800
Well, it is worth my while.

213
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:29.880
You will not have it back.

214
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.760
Thanks.

215
00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.400
(She's like)

216
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.730
(a whole different person.)

217
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:55.100
(Ning's Mansion)

218
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.920
Your Ladyship, how thoughtful of you.

219
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.010
You've even prepared

220
00:11:58.130 --> 00:11:59.280
motion sickness relief unguent
for Miss Wen.

221
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.560
I can't use that all up,

222
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:02.210
so why not share it?

223
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:03.160
And the other bottle

224
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.560
is for His Lordship, right?

225
00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:06.330
Shut up.

226
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:08.880
Miss Wen,

227
00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.040
I was going to see you.

228
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.010
What a coincidence, Sangyu.

229
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.920
I thought

230
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.400
the journey to Haifang

231
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.800
would be bumpy,

232
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:17.800
so…

233
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.450
Here it is.

234
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.800
Motion sickness relief unguent.

235
00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:22.130
You may find it useful.

236
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.920
How thoughtful of you, Sangyu.

237
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.610
But

238
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:27.520
isn't it coincidental?

239
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:28.760
For I, too, have prepared

240
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:29.970
a small gift for you.

241
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:31.730
What is it?

242
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.560
It is the cowpeas

243
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.920
that are freshly picked
in the countryside.

244
00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:35.970
They are really fresh.

245
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:37.330
It is my favorite food

246
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:38.800
made by my mother.

247
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:40.680
So I cooked the dish

248
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.400
the way my mother did,

249
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.010
and I want you to try it.

250
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.920
I hope you like it.

251
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:47.090
Sure.

252
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.560
I will give it a try.

253
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.280
I'll take it.

254
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:52.280
Thank you, Miss Wen.

255
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.800
Have it when it's hot.

256
00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:54.610
I will deliver more

257
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.800
to other rooms and His Lordship.

258
00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:57.640
OK.

259
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.210
Come on, try it.

260
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.330
Have a go.

261
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.850
Ning Yuxuan.

262
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.210
You've packed up your stuff?

263
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.970
I don't have anything to pack up really.

264
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.520
This is for you.

265
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.490
What is it?

266
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.090
Motion sickness relief unguent.

267
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.130
I gave one

268
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:35.850
to Miss Wen,

269
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.090
and here's the only one left.
You can have it.

270
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.490
Thanks.

271
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.210
It's the first time

272
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.280
I see a motion sickness relief unguent.

273
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.280
Weird stuff.

274
00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:53.490
Miss Wen put it here, didn't she?

275
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.640
She just dropped it.

276
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.560
I haven't got around to it.

277
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.730
I'll be off.

278
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.520
Having a stomachache?

279
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.090
Yeah.

280
00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:12.560
But you should thank me,

281
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.090
because if it wasn't me,

282
00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.010
you'd be the one

283
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.130
who's having a stomachache.

284
00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:19.280
What do you mean?

285
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:20.450
I ran into Miss Wen

286
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.280
earlier,

287
00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:22.520
and she cooked some cowpeas.

288
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.010
She said it was the first time
she tried to cook a dish like that,

289
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.040
so she was inexperienced.

290
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.280
I tried some,

291
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.130
and it seems it wasn't cooked through.

292
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.090
I think yours should be okay.

293
00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:34.680
Just give it a try.

294
00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.010
Not cooked through?

295
00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:40.210
How much did you eat?

296
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:41.880
Not much.

297
00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:44.250
It's really nice of her.

298
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:44.920
Just try some.

299
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.730
Go back to your room and lie down.

300
00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:46.800
I'll get a doctor.

301
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.680
I'm fine.

302
00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:51.760
Just relax.

303
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.520
See you around.

304
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.450
Have some.

305
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.040
Your Lordship,

306
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:23.880
we will set off early
in the morning tomorrow.

307
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:25.760
Why aren't you in bed?

308
00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:31.800
Sit.

309
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.680
I was about to go to bed.

310
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.730
But I came immediately

311
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.130
as soon as

312
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.680
you summoned me.

313
00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:42.280
Have some tea, Your Lordship.

314
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.680
It looks like

315
00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.490
you are all set.

316
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.680
I have prepared

317
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.040
some snacks

318
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:48.760
and the drugs that might be useful

319
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.400
for the journey.

320
00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:52.490
I have also made

321
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.850
a light gown for you.

322
00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.400
We will set off tomorrow,

323
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.450
so you have to be careful

324
00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.090
with what you eat tonight.

325
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.520
Especially undercooked cowpeas.

326
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.010
Thank you for your kind reminder.

327
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.920
I had a light dinner.

328
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.250
Undercooked cowpeas are poisonous.

329
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.040
You're aware of that, aren't you?

330
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.330
I have never heard of it.

331
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.090
I personally

332
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.560
gave the cowpeas that I cooked

333
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.210
to Her Ladyship.

334
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:29.370
Did…

335
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.210
Did she…

336
00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:33.800
Your Lordship,

337
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.160
I'm sorry.

338
00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.040
I really didn't know

339
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.760
that undercooked cowpeas
were poisonous.

340
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.250
Her Ladyship is so nice to me.

341
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:40.680
And she proposed to take me to Haifang.

342
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.400
How can I have the heart

343
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:43.250
to harm her?

344
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:44.970
Sit down.

345
00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:50.250
You don't have to explain.

346
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.640
You know exactly

347
00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.130
whether you did it on purpose or not.

348
00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:59.490
What do you mean, Your Lordship?

349
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.680
I didn't do that on purpose.

350
00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.210
Wen Wan.

351
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:06.970
I know that you held a grudge

352
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.320
against something happened before

353
00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:11.010
you were married or even earlier.

354
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:13.970
But this is not

355
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.170
how you get even,

356
00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:18.690
do you understand?

357
00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.360
Your Lordship,

358
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:25.080
you saved my life.

359
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.320
Without you,

360
00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.170
I don't even have the courage

361
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.450
to stay alive.

362
00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.650
You're everything to me,

363
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:32.120
Your Lordship.

364
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:34.450
Don't give me this nonsense.

365
00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:41.930
Stop your affectation.

366
00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.170
You will

367
00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:45.760
stay in the capital.

368
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.690
Your Lordship…

369
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.890
Think carefully

370
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.730
about what a life you will live.

371
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:50.450
Nie Sangyu is no longer the person

372
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.560
who she used to be.

373
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.170
Ever since she woke from the coma
after falling off the cliff,

374
00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:54.250
she has never done

375
00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:55.970
anything to harm you.

376
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.250
And what about you?

377
00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.890
You should put a stop to it, no?

378
00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.690
Your Lordship, it is all
but a misunderstanding.

379
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.730
I didn't do it on purpose.

380
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.890
Your Lordship, please trust me.

381
00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:10.560
I will set off tomorrow.

382
00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.490
I need to go to bed.

383
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.450
Go back to your room now.

384
00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.730
I will be praying for you

385
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.170
in the capital.

386
00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.970
May Lord bless you.

387
00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.010
Good night, Your Lordship.

388
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.970
(Nie Sangyu is guardless)

389
00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.490
(after she lost her memory.)

390
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.120
(I think I'd better warn her.)

391
00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:06.210
Easy, everybody.

392
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.840
Put it here.

393
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:08.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

394
00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:09.520
Here, here.

395
00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:10.930
Take it slow.

396
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.490
(Ning's Mansion)

397
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:12.970
Gui Bai,

398
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.010
how is it going?

399
00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.690
Your Lordship, we are ready.

400
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:17.170
Your Ladyship.

401
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.360
Is my wife's stuff

402
00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:20.410
all ready?

403
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.120
Muxu got two crates here,

404
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:23.250
and they are on the carriage.

405
00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:24.170
As for the rest,

406
00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:26.210
Her Ladyship insisted that she
will carry them herself.

407
00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:28.890
Is that so?

408
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:29.450
Yeah.

409
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.840
All the important stuff

410
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.490
will stay with me.

411
00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:35.840
Suit yourself.

412
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:37.800
Mr. Liu,

413
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:39.080
please look after the Mansion

414
00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.320
while I'm away.

415
00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.730
Sure thing, Your Lordship.

416
00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.800
Your Lordship, it's about time.

417
00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:44.800
We should get going.

418
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.540
(Ning's Mansion)

419
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.360
Your Ladyship,

420
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:52.840
take care of yourself.

421
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:53.840
Don't worry.

422
00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:54.600
If I have time,

423
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:55.690
I will write a letter to you.

424
00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.010
My dear, let's go.

425
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.320
I need to go.

426
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.170
Wait.

427
00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.450
Wait.

428
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.930
Your Lordship, give me a minute.

429
00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:11.410
It is hot and humid in Haifang,

430
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.080
so I have prepared

431
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.490
this straw mat for you, Your Lordship.

432
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.560
I hope you take good care of yourself

433
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:15.970
in Haifang.

434
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.320
I will keep a vegetarian diet

435
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.650
in the capital

436
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.170
and pray for you.

437
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.280
Your Lordship,

438
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.450
I made a mistake.

439
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.490
Please forgive me.

440
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.280
You should apologize

441
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.410
to the First Lady.

442
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.410
Your Ladyship,

443
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.280
I'm sorry.

444
00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.120
I didn't know what I was thinking.

445
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.080
Please forgive me

446
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.450
and take the straw mat.

447
00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.120
I forgive you.

448
00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.560
But please keep the straw mat.

449
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.490
Thank you for your forgiveness.

450
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.450
Farewell, Your Ladyship.

451
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.120
Safe travels.

452
00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:46.340
(Ship Sea-returning)

453
00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:03.540
(Sang Shen)

454
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.060
(Ji Ming)

455
00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:19.690
Sir!

456
00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.210
Sir!

457
00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.560
Sir!

458
00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:29.760
Sir!

459
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.120
Sir!

460
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.520
Sir!

461
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:35.210
- Sir.
- Sang Shen.

462
00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:35.840
You are home, sir.

463
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:36.890
I miss you so much.

464
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.930
What took you so long?

465
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:38.320
Alright, alright.

466
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.170
Look how thin I am.

467
00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.360
I couldn't eat or sleep well
without you.

468
00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.080
Sir, have you eaten well?

469
00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:42.010
Sang Shen, where's Man'er?

470
00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:42.930
Did you have fun?

471
00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:07.560
Sang Shen!

472
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:09.360
For three months I was on the sea,

473
00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:11.490
my daughter said she was in Haifang,

474
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.840
but here you tell me

475
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.010
that she left Haifang

476
00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.280
two months ago.

477
00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:16.410
Where did she go?

478
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:17.600
Sir,

479
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.930
she has gone to the capital…

480
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:21.490
To… To…

481
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.410
Speak!

482
00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:23.250
Sir,

483
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.360
she has gone to the capital
to see her love.

484
00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:27.080
Her love?

485
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:29.490
Ridiculous.

486
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:33.560
No.

487
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.600
I will set off immediately

488
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.170
to the capital.

489
00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:39.600
Yes, sir.

490
00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.010
Who prepared these?

491
00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.490
How sweet!

492
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:01.930
It's…

493
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:02.650
Mr. Liu.

494
00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:05.450
I knew it was him.

495
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.320
You must give him a raise.

496
00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:08.560
OK.

497
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.560
I got it.

498
00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:15.600
What are you reading?

499
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:16.690
Some information

500
00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:17.760
about Haifang.

501
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.210
Is there anything interesting?

502
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.040
Share with me.

503
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.010
Haifang was originally
a small fishing village

504
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.250
that was sparsely populated.

505
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.080
Pirates used to sell

506
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:29.890
their lootings

507
00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.450
in Haifang.

508
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.010
With more and more merchants
coming to the place,

509
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:33.970
they chipped in

510
00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.410
to build a private port.

511
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.170
Over the years, it's become

512
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:37.970
the place for oversea merchants

513
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.490
to trade merchandises.

514
00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.010
A market built by pirates?

515
00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:42.040
The government did nothing?

516
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:43.730
They couldn't do anything about it.

517
00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:45.690
Three county magistrates

518
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.320
died mysteriously.

519
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.410
The land of tigers and wolves.

520
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.250
It may refer to this place.

521
00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:55.410
Three county magistrates
died mysteriously?

522
00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:00.080
So a local official may die tragically?

523
00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:06.010
So do you regret

524
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:07.280
coming along with me?

525
00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.450
No way.

526
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.800
I did my research, too,

527
00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.690
before I came.

528
00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.210
Can you hear me out?

529
00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.410
Tell me about it, then.

530
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.650
The most famous food in Haifang

531
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.520
is Li's Roast Chicken,

532
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:27.730
Uncle Yao's Beef,

533
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.010
Mrs. Song's Stew and Rice.

534
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.650
Cai's Quail Soup is good, too.

535
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.730
And Sticky Rice Ball with Meat Stuffing.

536
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.010
So this is the research you did?

537
00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.410
Not just Haifang,

538
00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.450
I have studied all the good eating

539
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.890
along the way.

540
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.970
Stay with me, and you'll be well fed.

541
00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:46.450
Gui Bai,

542
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.080
will we arrive in Jishui City soon?

543
00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.040
Yes.

544
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:50.280
I tell you what,

545
00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.250
the rice there is wonderful.

546
00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:53.730
And Caozhou's beef…

547
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.650
After working with him for years,

548
00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.650
I'm very clear what he's like

549
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.560
as an opponent.

550
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.560
He must have found something

551
00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.490
or His Majesty wouldn't
send him to Haifang.

552
00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:32.690
Ning Yuxuan only has
a few guards with him.

553
00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:34.650
He's vulnerable at the moment.

554
00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.010
Take him down on his journey.

555
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:37.890
Yes.

556
00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:56.970
Ning Yuxuan.

557
00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.010
Can we take a break?

558
00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.760
What's the rush?

559
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.170
It's a long way to Haifang.

560
00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:17.970
There's no time to waste.

561
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.600
You're not sleeping.

562
00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:23.320
Y-You startled me.

563
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.420
(Linhai Post House)

564
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.040
Your Lordship, we have arrived
at a post house.

565
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:44.970
We have?

566
00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:57.760
Gui Bai.

567
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.450
Would you please talk to the owner

568
00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.890
to check us in?

569
00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.560
Why me?

570
00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.600
Gui Bai can do it.

571
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.520
I will see to it.

572
00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:10.320
No, you will not.

573
00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.250
Only you can get it done, my wife.

574
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.760
Again, why me?

575
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:20.250
You have the title with you,

576
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.930
so they will offer you better rooms.

577
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.520
This is the reason

578
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:33.840
why you brought me with you, huh?

579
00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:35.210
You said it.

580
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.600
Your rank is higher than mine.

581
00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:37.730
The higher the rank,

582
00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.410
the better the room.

583
00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:40.730
Why wouldn't I take advantage of it?

584
00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.040
You think I will fall for it?

585
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:42.970
I don't believe you, Ning Yuxuan,

586
00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:44.600
would be so petty.

587
00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:47.970
Tell me, what other reasons?

588
00:28:52.010 --> 00:28:53.170
Well, there is

589
00:28:53.490 --> 00:28:54.210
another reason.

590
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:55.490
I knew it.

591
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.760
I bet

592
00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:00.360
you feel honored

593
00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.410
to have me, an imperial mandate lady,
with you, right?

594
00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.120
I brought you with me

595
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:16.320
because I wanted to make sure
you wouldn't tear down my house.

596
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:17.040
You…

597
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.280
I…

598
00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.250
Alright, give me back my bead.

599
00:29:25.690 --> 00:29:26.650
Why?

600
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.170
You begged me to bring you with me.

601
00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:32.800
Fine.

602
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.520
I will get you

603
00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.080
a premium room, then.

604
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:36.970
Muxu.

605
00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.250
Thank you, my dear.

606
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:43.280
Check us in.

607
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:48.980
(By God's will, I hereby appoint
the wife of Marquis Moyu, Lady Nie Sangyu,)

608
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:51.340
(as the Second-rank Lady
with Imperial Mandate.)

609
00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:53.410
Your Ladyship.

610
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:56.560
Lean over.

611
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:00.280
Give me a woodshed.

612
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:03.520
I don't think that's appropriate.

613
00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:04.690
That's fine.

614
00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:05.490
OK.

615
00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.360
Put it away.

616
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:15.490
Your Ladyship, here's the key.

617
00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.600
Thanks.

618
00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:19.800
All done.

619
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.840
Which room will I live in?

620
00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.340
(Woodshed)

621
00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:25.490
You will sleep in a woodshed,
and I will sleep in a premium room.

622
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.890
Why woodshed for me?

623
00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.040
The owner said

624
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.320
that my status

625
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:38.210
only works for myself.

626
00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.730
No special treatment for the family.

627
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.210
Nothing I can do, right?

628
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:42.840
A premium room

629
00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:44.410
is a standard offer
for a rank 2 titled lady,

630
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.280
and a woodshed is for
a rank-7 county magistrate.

631
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:50.560
You figure it out.

632
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.760
Don't you have anything to say?

633
00:31:05.250 --> 00:31:06.040
Nothing.

634
00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.730
It surprises me that Ning Yuxuan

635
00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:36.410
didn't fight me over the premium room.

636
00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.690
I haven't had a chat
with them for a long time.

637
00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.010
Your Lordship,

638
00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:12.120
I just led my men on a patrol

639
00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:13.320
around the post house,

640
00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.520
and we found nothing.

641
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.010
Search again.

642
00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:17.320
I don't think Ling Jianxing

643
00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:18.800
would miss out on the opportunity.

644
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.890
It cannot be

645
00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:22.760
a quiet journey.

646
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:24.890
Yes, Your Lordship.

647
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.250
I haven't seen so many stars
in such a long time.

648
00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.080
I tell you what,

649
00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:55.360
I met some weird people

650
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:57.010
recently,

651
00:32:57.490 --> 00:32:59.410
some weird things,

652
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.120
and a very dislikeable person.

653
00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:13.120
(Consul Ning.)

654
00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:14.250
You are lucky

655
00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:15.410
to have a good wife.

656
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.120
Now, the entire capital city

657
00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.410
knows that the Ning family

658
00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:19.730
has been loyal for generations,

659
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.930
and that Marquis Moyu was framed.

660
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:22.600
As we speak,

661
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.890
those petitioners who support you

662
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:26.040
are swarming

663
00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:27.120
outside the gate of my palace.

664
00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.320
I apologize, Your Majesty.

665
00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.170
I have a playful wife.

666
00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:31.560
I assure you

667
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.970
that she shall be disciplined.

668
00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:42.690
Again,

669
00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:44.520
thanks to your wife,

670
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.650
my problem

671
00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.840
has been solved.

672
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:50.760
She gave me a reason

673
00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:53.560
to release you.

674
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.010
Arise.

675
00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.690
Come forth.

676
00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:08.330
I'm aware

677
00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.160
that you were framed.

678
00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.600
But do you know

679
00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.600
who did it?

680
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:16.890
I have done an investigation.

681
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.200
And everything

682
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:19.970
leads to Haifang.

683
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.890
I knew I could trust you.

684
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.200
Haifang is a place

685
00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.080
full of oversea merchants.

686
00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:26.410
It cannot be avoided

687
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.160
on the way to the central plains.

688
00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:29.160
In the past,

689
00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:30.560
my late father's

690
00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.850
county system project failed in Haifang.

691
00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.080
The local merchants

692
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.200
collided with the bandits,

693
00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:36.640
and almost took

694
00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:37.450
over the administrative authority

695
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.240
of Haifang.

696
00:34:39.450 --> 00:34:41.850
The officials that I sent there

697
00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:45.200
either joined them

698
00:34:45.490 --> 00:34:48.330
or died in mysterious ways.

699
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.200
Haifang is in Lord Tan's jurisdiction.

700
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:55.810
I volunteer to

701
00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.200
go to Haifang.

702
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.770
I knew you are the right person.

703
00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:02.560
You will help me

704
00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.160
take over the administrative authority.

705
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:07.810
The place

706
00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:09.930
must be under my rule.

707
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.120
It will be a pioneer area

708
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:14.520
for the tax reform.

709
00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:16.970
You will govern the place,

710
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.120
and I'm sure

711
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:19.330
Haifang has

712
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:20.850
great potential.

713
00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:22.640
Then, I'll have a reason

714
00:35:22.810 --> 00:35:24.850
to transfer you back to the capital.

715
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.490
Understood, Your Majesty.

716
00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:35.490
(The journey to Haifang shall be precarious.)

717
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:37.770
(Dad, please look over me)

718
00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:39.930
(and help me find the remnants
of the Tea Gang.)

719
00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.640
(I will avenge you)

720
00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:45.160
(and bring peace to the country)

721
00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.330
(so you can rest in peace.)

722
00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:50.160
But soon, I will

723
00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.850
be in a new place.

724
00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.330
I hope…

725
00:35:56.490 --> 00:35:57.720
I hope things can be different

726
00:35:57.850 --> 00:35:59.490
at this new place,

727
00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:01.850
so I can forget about

728
00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:02.770
all the annoying stuff.

729
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.160
If…

730
00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:10.010
What are you doing here?

731
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.410
I…

732
00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:14.640
I'm taking a walk.

733
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.770
What are you doing here?

734
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:19.080
Taking a walk?

735
00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:30.640
If you want your room changed,

736
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:32.200
you can forget about it.

737
00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:38.040
Tomorrow

738
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.890
will be a bright day.

739
00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.450
Look at all those shining stars.

740
00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:44.490
You know these?

741
00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:46.120
You don't believe me?

742
00:36:46.490 --> 00:36:47.520
You'll see tomorrow

743
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.680
if I'm right or not.

744
00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:58.930
Ning Yuxuan,

745
00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.160
look.

746
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:05.890
Look at that star.

747
00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:06.810
The brightest one.

748
00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:07.890
Do you know what it's called?

749
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.410
What?

750
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:10.720
You don't know, huh?

751
00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:13.890
It is Triads.

752
00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:15.330
It appears at that point

753
00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:16.890
every single day.

754
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.290
I saw it back in the Mansion,

755
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:19.720
but it wasn't this bright.

756
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:21.970
Also,

757
00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.290
opposite to it

758
00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:24.560
is a star

759
00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:25.370
called Heart.

760
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:26.120
Those two stars

761
00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:27.720
will never meet.

762
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:28.850
When one comes out,
the other goes away.

763
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:29.600
Whenever

764
00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:30.850
the two of them appear,

765
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:32.290
you can judge the next day's weather

766
00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:33.640
and the current hour

767
00:37:33.770 --> 00:37:35.160
through their positions

768
00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:37.010
and the hour they appear.

769
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:38.240
Pretty cool, huh?

770
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:39.240
When did you

771
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.120
learn horoscope?

772
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:42.810
It's very simple.

773
00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.240
I don't know

774
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:44.970
when I learned it.

775
00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:45.890
It just popped

776
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.890
out of my mind suddenly.

777
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:48.330
Also,

778
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.040
their positions

779
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.240
and the hours,

780
00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:52.600
these are simple knowledge.

781
00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:53.450
It's not so difficult.

782
00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.520
So did something else

783
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:55.640
pop out

784
00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.290
of your mind?

785
00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:57.970
Something else?

786
00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:58.930
For example,

787
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:01.330
memories from the past.

788
00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:11.850
No.

789
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:13.720
Everything that they told me

790
00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:14.970
that I did before,

791
00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:16.160
I don't remember anything.

792
00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.600
I don't mind not having any friends.

793
00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.200
I've got the stars.

794
00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:28.410
The stars are my friends.

795
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.290
Here's another secret of mine.

796
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:30.970
I used to sneak out

797
00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:31.970
to talk to the stars

798
00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.240
all the time.

799
00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:34.240
Talk to the stars?

800
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:34.850
Yeah.

801
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:39.600
I need your shoulder.

802
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:40.490
What?

803
00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:45.080
You know what?

804
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.520
Someone told me

805
00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.560
that every dead one on Earth

806
00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.370
would turn into a star in the sky,

807
00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.560
and they would

808
00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.680
watch over us

809
00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:55.680
from the sky.

810
00:38:59.080 --> 00:38:59.850
