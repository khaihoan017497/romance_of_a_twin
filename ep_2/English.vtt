00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.980
=Episode 2=

3
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.980
I'm turning around.

4
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.180
But you...

5
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.060
Ning Yuxuan!

6
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.700
Anyone? Help!

7
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.910
Here.

8
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.110
Forget it.

9
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.190
Is it thick enough?

10
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.110
It should be thick enough.

11
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.540
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

12
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.670
No way.

13
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.190
I have to ask for help.

14
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.420
Hold on...

15
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.700
He's asleep?

16
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.630
You are sleeping soundly.

17
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.980
Whether you're awake or not,

18
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.740
listen to me.

19
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.390
Someone set the fire in the kitchen

20
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.700
deliberately to set me up.

21
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.910
Can you believe that

22
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.740
the kitchen door was locked
from outside?

23
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.910
It was locked from outside!

24
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.700
I was stunned

25
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.700
that someone hates me so much.

26
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.860
Tell him that

27
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.670
don't let me find out who he is.

28
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.140
Otherwise, I will not

29
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.260
show mercy.

30
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.470
Right.

31
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.020
The key.

32
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:34.660
(Be Simple and Real)

33
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.300
Here.

34
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.020
Your Lordship.

35
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.420
Your Lordship.

36
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.420
Got you.

37
00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.020
(Virtue Prevails)

38
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.110
Your Lordship.

39
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:06.830
How are you?

40
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.620
What's up?

41
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.110
I saw the First Lady

42
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.710
at the fire scene late last night.

43
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.350
Nie Sangyu?

44
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.030
Yes.

45
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.150
Why did she go there?

46
00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.350
She seemed to be looking
for something.

47
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.420
Are you sure?

48
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:30.620
Totally sure.

49
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.910
Tell everyone to go to the lobby.

50
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.300
Yes, sir.

51
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.900
Your Ladyship.

52
00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.860
Hold back your temper

53
00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.460
after a while.

54
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.300
Why should I do this?

55
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.180
Don't you know?

56
00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.380
Now there are rumors outside that

57
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:40.660
you set fire to the kitchen,

58
00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:41.300
intending to burn Miss Wen

59
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.740
in Wanqing Pavilion next door to death.

60
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.540
Ridiculous.

61
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.060
I locked myself inside

62
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.660
and set fire

63
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.180
to burn the house next door?

64
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.180
Would anyone believe it?

65
00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.780
I definitely don't believe it.

66
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.820
But rumors are fierce.

67
00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.380
You'd better make it clear.

68
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:01.380
No worries.
A clean hand wants no washing.

69
00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:01.860
I am not afraid at all.

70
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.180
Let's go.

71
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.980
Your Ladyship.

72
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.300
That's Miss Wen.

73
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.540
Miss Wen.

74
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.500
Your Ladyship.

75
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.380
What happened

76
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:20.820
to you?

77
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.540
I'm fine.

78
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.260
Your Ladyship.

79
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:24.500
I am like this

80
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.180
by accident.

81
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.860
It has nothing to do with you.

82
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:28.660
Second Lady.

83
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.660
Your Ladyship.

84
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.500
Did you forget that

85
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:31.460
you stabbed her?

86
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.060
Right.

87
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.770
You...

88
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.300
That's what I wanted to ask.

89
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.380
Are you

90
00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.140
feeling better?

91
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:40.900
Yes.

92
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.820
I am fine.

93
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.900
It's okay, Your Ladyship.

94
00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:44.140
It has nothing to do with you.

95
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.540
I didn't mean to put on the coat.

96
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.180
Your Ladyship.

97
00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:48.460
It was His Lordship who put it on for me.

98
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:50.060
Please don't blame me.

99
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.060
I didn't want to

100
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.900
blame you.

101
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.860
I just want to...

102
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.140
I just don't know...

103
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.140
Excuse me.

104
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.380
Miss Wen.

105
00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:56.940
You...

106
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.460
Take care.

107
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:02.140
Your Ladyship, let's go.

108
00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.060
Take care.

109
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:20.900
Quickly take the clothes

110
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.980
back to His Lordship's room.

111
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:22.500
Yes.

112
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.220
Go.

113
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:25.780
Yes.

114
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:27.260
Let's go.

115
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.900
- Your Ladyship.
- Your Ladyship.

116
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.820
- Your Ladyship.
- Your Ladyship.

117
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.660
Your Ladyship.

118
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.100
- Your Ladyship.
- Your Ladyship.

119
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:43.140
Your Ladyship.

120
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:51.260
Ning Yuxuan.

121
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.940
Are you okay?

122
00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:55.700
Listen to me.

123
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.700
Yesterday's situation was super dire.

124
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.500
You fainted.

125
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.020
I saved you.

126
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.420
You don't even say thank you.

127
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.060
Nie Sangyu.

128
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.700
I asked you to reflect on yourself

129
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.740
in Reflection Pavilion.

130
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.860
Why did you show up privately
last night?

131
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.100
You have to explain to us

132
00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.660
about the fire in the kitchen.

133
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.500
Hold on.

134
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.740
I didn't set the fire.

135
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:27.620
Then why were you

136
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.540
in the kitchen last night?

137
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.300
I was hungry

138
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.340
and looking for food.

139
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.020
Any evidence?

140
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:35.500
No one can prove it.

141
00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.500
Since there is no evidence,

142
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.540
I would like to hear your explanation.

143
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.220
Since everyone wants to know,

144
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.500
I will describe to you

145
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.780
what happened yesterday.

146
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.980
Here's the thing.

147
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:47.340
The fire

148
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.060
was kindled from the outside.

149
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:50.060
But

150
00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.980
I was inside the house.

151
00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.020
And

152
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.780
the kitchen door

153
00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:56.020
was locked from outside.

154
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.260
If it was really me who set the fire,

155
00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.580
someone had to

156
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.940
cooperate with me.

157
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:02.220
Who do you think this person is?

158
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.540
No.

159
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.380
It's not me.

160
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.180
I was sleeping

161
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:08.500
in Reflection Pavilion last night.

162
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.340
The steward, Nanny Liu,
can testify for me.

163
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.980
Yes. She's right.

164
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.700
The fire started at 9 pm.

165
00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:15.980
Mr. Liu.

166
00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:17.660
Your Lordship.

167
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.340
The servants of the outer court
have a curfew,

168
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.700
so they were all in their rooms.

169
00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.380
But the few first-class maids

170
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.540
in the inner court

171
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.620
are not under my control.

172
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.180
Which ones are first-class maids?

173
00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:31.180
First-class maids are

174
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.340
(Qian Lianxue)
Muxu,

175
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:34.700
Banxia and Tanxiang.

176
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.140
- We're wronged, Your Lordship.
- Banxia.

177
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.020
We're wronged.

178
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:41.740
Get up.

179
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.700
Wait, just...

180
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.860
(Tanxiang, Banxia)

181
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.140
The arsonist

182
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.100
did have an omission.

183
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.580
I'm afraid she doesn't know it herself.

184
00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:57.460
That's it.

185
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.180
Someone locked the kitchen door

186
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.660
with this hairpin.

187
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.220
A burnt hairpin

188
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.900
and the door lock.

189
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.460
Here is the evidence.

190
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.660
Someone deliberately

191
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:08.620
harmed me

192
00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.100
and almost killed me.

193
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.420
Your Ladyship, but

194
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.620
how do you know that this hairpin

195
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.700
was what locked the door?

196
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.300
Because that's what I found

197
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.100
at the fire scene.

198
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.020
These things

199
00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:21.540
were indeed picked up

200
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.780
by First Lady at the fire scene.

201
00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.460
I saw it with my own eyes.

202
00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:27.300
You should believe what Gui Bai said.

203
00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:27.860
Right?

204
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.780
The hairpin has been burnt like this.

205
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.740
How to prove

206
00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.140
whose hairpin it is?

207
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.100
Right.

208
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.660
In fact, I just

209
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.100
walked around

210
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:40.060
all of you.

211
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.340
It's not for nothing.

212
00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:42.780
I found that

213
00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.740
someone in this room

214
00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:47.500
did smell like

215
00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.540
the smell left

216
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.700
on this hairpin.

217
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.460
Well...

218
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.060
That person seems to be right ahead.

219
00:11:58.980 --> 00:11:59.700
Your Ladyship.

220
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.180
Banxia has always been upright and honest.

221
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:03.860
She'll never set a fire.

222
00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.700
(Looks like I have to be fierce.)

223
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.060
Mr. Liu.

224
00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:10.500
According to the family rules

225
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:11.500
I set before,

226
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.820
how should we deal with

227
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.700
the person who set the fire?

228
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.220
According to the family rules

229
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.900
established by First Lady before,

230
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.900
if a servant commits evil deeds

231
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.580
such as poisoning or arson,

232
00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.380
he will be punished

233
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:24.260
in his own way.

234
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.060
She will be burned to death.

235
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.900
If they shield each other,

236
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.260
they will be punished equally.

237
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:33.580
Your Ladyship.

238
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:34.980
It was me.

239
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.180
It was me.

240
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:37.780
It was me.

241
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.060
I set the fire.

242
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.940
My Lady doesn't know anything.

243
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.460
Your Ladyship, it was me.

244
00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.340
This...

245
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:43.820
Banxia.

246
00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.500
This has nothing to do with her.

247
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:47.820
She doesn't know anything.

248
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.060
I'm begging you.

249
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:49.660
Banxia!

250
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:51.260
Your Ladyship. Your Ladyship.

251
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.340
Banxia. Banxia.

252
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.940
- Your Ladyship, burn me.
- Banxia.

253
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.060
Don't sully your innocence

254
00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.220
just because you're afraid.

255
00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:00.460
Banxia.

256
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.940
Why did you set the fire last night?

257
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.380
I...

258
00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:05.980
I didn't want to

259
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.180
burn First Lady to death.

260
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:09.660
It's just that

261
00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.340
when I woke up at night

262
00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.540
and saw First Lady in the kitchen,

263
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:15.660
I had a feeling of resentment.

264
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.940
I just wanted to set a fire

265
00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.540
to scare First Lady.

266
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:20.900
I really didn't expect

267
00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.580
the fire to be so fierce.

268
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.580
I really didn't expect it.

269
00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:26.260
I mean it.

270
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:26.660
Banxia.

271
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:27.580
Why are you so confused?

272
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.020
Why did you harm First Lady?

273
00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:29.700
Say it.

274
00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.060
Why did you harm First Lady?

275
00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.460
Because...

276
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.220
Horrible.

277
00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.580
Thanks to First Lady.

278
00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:55.580
Plum blossom mark.

279
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.380
My body

280
00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.620
was ruined by you.

281
00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:04.260
So I felt resentful.

282
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.780
Put on your clothes first.

283
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.060
Don't get close.

284
00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.700
Is this really what I did?

285
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:17.460
Banxia.

286
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:19.940
Why didn't you tell me?

287
00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:21.340
My Lady.

288
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.420
I'm afraid of dragging you down.

289
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:27.980
My life is worth nothing.

290
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.300
What's more,

291
00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:30.580
you know that

292
00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:32.380
the servants punished

293
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.500
by First Lady

294
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.740
are not allowed
to seek medical treatment.

295
00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.500
I couldn't do that.

296
00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.500
I'm afraid of dragging you down.

297
00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.100
Your Ladyship.

298
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:46.660
I got you wrong.

299
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.380
It's my fault.

300
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:51.180
Sorry.

301
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:52.540
Here.

302
00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:55.340
Your Ladyship.

303
00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.260
I am begging you.

304
00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.260
Let Banxia go.

305
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.700
I am begging you, Your Ladyship.

306
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:00.460
Get up.

307
00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:02.140
I am begging you, Your Ladyship.

308
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:03.180
Get up.

309
00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:05.460
Nie Sangyu.

310
00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:09.020
What are you going to do with Banxia?

311
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.940
Muxu said before that

312
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.140
I made many mistakes,

313
00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.900
but I didn't believe it.

314
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.340
I thought that...

315
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.180
Miss Wen.

316
00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.740
I stabbed you before.

317
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.420
Sorry.

318
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.220
Banxia.

319
00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.540
Although you set the fire,

320
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.020
I hurt you

321
00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:51.580
first.

322
00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.380
So...

323
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.540
So the one who should apologize
is actually me.

324
00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.900
Sorry.

325
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.420
Everyone is here today.

326
00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:09.460
If I did something

327
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:10.380
that hurt you

328
00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.660
in the past,

329
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:12.940
I am here today

330
00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.180
to apologize to you.

331
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.060
I hope

332
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:17.900
you can forgive me.

333
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:33.940
And those

334
00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.300
sensational family rules

335
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.020
will be abolished from today.

336
00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:37.940
All abolished.

337
00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:38.860
Not a single one left.

338
00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:40.260
You don't have to

339
00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.460
be afraid anymore.

340
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.140
Since First Lady forgave Banxia,

341
00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:47.020
this matter is over.

342
00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:50.820
Behave yourselves from now on

343
00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:52.780
and never make any trouble.

344
00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.860
- Get to work.
- Get to work.

345
00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.220
Yes.

346
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:22.780
Go.

347
00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.620
Let's go.

348
00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:25.340
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

349
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:27.020
The scar

350
00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.420
on Banxia's shoulder

351
00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.660
may need

352
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.660
Scar Recovering Cream.

353
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.900
What?

354
00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:38.660
Let's go

355
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.380
buy the ingredients
for Scar Recovery Cream!

356
00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.060
What do you think of

357
00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.940
Nie Sangyu's performance just now?

358
00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:49.460
First Lady was so witty

359
00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.780
that she found out the real arsonist
in one fell swoop.

360
00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.140
Don't you think
she's totally different?

361
00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.300
Not only did her temperament
change drastically,

362
00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.780
but she managed to
extricate herself this time.

363
00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:02.860
The former Nie Sangyu

364
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.460
couldn't make it.

365
00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.420
How about I go to the temple

366
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.300
to check

367
00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.100
if anything

368
00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:09.900
collides with First Lady?

369
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:12.060
I don't believe

370
00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.620
in ghosts and gods.

371
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.620
Go to the temple to check it out.

372
00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:22.940
Yes.

373
00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:25.860
Your Lordship.

374
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.380
Let me change your clothes for you.

375
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.020
No need.

376
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.660
Don't forget that

377
00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:40.860
we're not a real couple.

378
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.220
I'll send you away
after the trouble is over.

379
00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:47.620
Leave me alone.

380
00:18:58.980 --> 00:18:59.860
Your Ladyship.

381
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:04.900
This...

382
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.820
This is all my belongings?

383
00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.780
Since you came to Reflection Pavilion,

384
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.260
your monthly supply
has been cut a lot.

385
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:14.220
We simply don't have the money

386
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.260
to buy the materials

387
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.100
for the Scar Recovery Cream
you mentioned.

388
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.860
I have been the First Lady

389
00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:23.580
in Ning's Mansion for four years.

390
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.540
Do I only have these little savings?

391
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:31.700
Dowry.

392
00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.940
Bring me my dowry.

393
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.660
Dowry?

394
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.300
Back then, you were determined
to marry His Lordship,

395
00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.660
which caused an uproar
in the whole city.

396
00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.500
General Nie was extremely angry.

397
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.180
Not to mention the dowry,

398
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.580
there was no betrothal presents.

399
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.500
So...

400
00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.940
So I came with nothing?

401
00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:54.300
Go.

402
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:54.900
Bring me

403
00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:56.140
everything that looks valuable

404
00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:56.740
in this house.

405
00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:57.860
Hurry.

406
00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.060
There is a box.

407
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:03.980
What's this?

408
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:04.460
This is

409
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.020
your

410
00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.100
most precious stuff.

411
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:11.260
Quite heavy.

412
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.700
As I expected,

413
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:15.860
I can't be so stupid

414
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.700
that I don't even have
any private money.

415
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:19.420
It's locked.

416
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:20.420
Give me the key.

417
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:21.180
You keep

418
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.220
the key yourself.

419
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.820
I didn't even give you the key.

420
00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:27.620
Looks like it's a treasure.

421
00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.980
Your Ladyship, what are you going to do?

422
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:35.540
Pry it open.

423
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.220
Your Ladyship, take care.

424
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.620
Done.

425
00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.220
Let's see what it is.

426
00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.020
This...

427
00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.140
- Ning Yuxuan?
- His Lordship.

428
00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.260
Ning Yuxuan.

429
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.820
Why are they all his portraits?

430
00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:04.700
These are things that

431
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:05.820
you regard as treasures.

432
00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:06.980
All portraits of His Lordship.

433
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.660
Your Ladyship, you really

434
00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.540
have a deep love for His Lordship.

435
00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.420
What about my bank notes?

436
00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.060
What about my taels?

437
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:17.780
Well...

438
00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:19.620
I have no idea.

439
00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.140
Your Ladyship.

440
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:23.660
I...

441
00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.220
Your Ladyship.

442
00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.020
Miss Qian Lianxue

443
00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.180
is hosting a banquet
at Kuixing Restaurant

444
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.460
and invited you to attend.

445
00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:33.780
Who?

446
00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.980
(Kuixing Restaurant)
(Qian Lianxue is His Lordship's cousin.)

447
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.060
(She lives in the Marquis's Mansion)

448
00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.060
(because of her family's decline.)

449
00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.620
(By the way,)

450
00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.660
(she is Miss Xue)

451
00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.580
(who pleaded for Banxia before.)

452
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.580
I'm here to apologize to Your Ladyship.

453
00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:46.620
Look.

454
00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.100
Why did you apologize

455
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:49.180
as soon as we met?

456
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:49.900
Your Ladyship.

457
00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.740
I've always had a clearcut stand
on right and wrong.

458
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.300
It was my fault before.

459
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:54.380
I got you wrong.

460
00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:55.180
No.

461
00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:55.740
And

462
00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.580
my maid Banxia

463
00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:57.860
intended to burn you to death.

464
00:21:58.020 --> 00:21:59.020
Her crime is punishable.

465
00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:00.020
As her master,

466
00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:00.860
I should be responsible.

467
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.500
I hope Your Ladyship will forgive me.

468
00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.020
Look.

469
00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.020
Miss Xue.

470
00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.180
I have said that

471
00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.500
the past is over.

472
00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.460
No need to mention it again.

473
00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:10.940
You...

474
00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.220
Take a seat.

475
00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:19.820
Sit.

476
00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.340
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

477
00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:22.820
You are welcome.

478
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.660
Your good intentions

479
00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.260
have made me

480
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.860
very happy.

481
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.900
It's all vegetarian.

482
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:38.580
Your Ladyship,
you were a vegetarian before,

483
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.220
so I specially ordered

484
00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:41.420
all vegetarian dishes for you.

485
00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:45.660
Right.

486
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.380
But I have changed now.

487
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.180
I am no longer vegetarian.

488
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:48.980
Now I only eat meat.

489
00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:49.780
Just order

490
00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:50.820
rich food for me.

491
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:53.860
Banxia, go.

492
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.180
Order meat for First Lady.

493
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:55.900
Thank you.

494
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:56.300
Yes.

495
00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:58.980
What's the noise?

496
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:07.540
Mr. Ning!

497
00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.020
Ning Yuxuan?

498
00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:13.740
Your Ladyship.

499
00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.900
Did you forget that

500
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.700
my cousin works here?

501
00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:26.940
He is here?

502
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.820
Greetings to Mr. Ling.

503
00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.740
(Ling Jianxing)

504
00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:42.660
Mr. Ning.

505
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:44.980
Mr. Ling.

506
00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:46.820
Mr. Ning is indeed diligently
engaged in government affairs.

507
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.180
You can still calmly be
in Politics Hall

508
00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.220
in this situation.

509
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.140
Politics Hall is a place

510
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.260
for handling public affairs.

511
00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.940
Mr. Ling, you have been
an official for many years,

512
00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.300
do you choose your days
for office work?

513
00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.820
Mr. Ning's romantic affairs

514
00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.780
caused an uproar.

515
00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.780
Your wife and concubine
fought for your favor,

516
00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.140
and the wounding happened
on the spot.

517
00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.020
Bandits suddenly appeared

518
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.540
to disrupt the wedding banquet.

519
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:16.460
Even a drama

520
00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:18.140
won't be arranged in this way.

521
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.460
It seems that Mr. Ling

522
00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:23.580
is a drama lover.

523
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.980
Of course I am.

524
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:27.260
But

525
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.460
I don't like dramas

526
00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.420
choreographed by scholars.

527
00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.500
I do like those

528
00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:35.900
choreographed by Mr. Ning.

529
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.620
Mr. Ling, what you love

530
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.780
is not only watching dramas,

531
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.700
but also writing them.

532
00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.300
I think it's unfair to you.

533
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.380
Who would have thought that

534
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:53.460
the world's role model Marquis Moyu

535
00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:56.220
would one day be entangled
in scandal?

536
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.300
I really don't know if this is

537
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.020
good news or bad news.

538
00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.020
Everyone said that my cousin

539
00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:12.900
is like an immortal.

540
00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:13.700
The gentleman is like a gem,

541
00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.580
unparalleled in the world.

542
00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.060
So

543
00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:15.860
many people in the capital

544
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:16.860
are obsessed with my cousin.

545
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.740
They gather together

546
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.420
in the private room of the restaurant
opposite the Politics Hall,

547
00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:19.860
in order to

548
00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:21.300
catch a glimpse of my cousin
from afar

549
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:22.260
when he goes in and out

550
00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.700
of the government office.

551
00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.780
You must be exaggerating.

552
00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:30.580
What's so good about him?

553
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:33.620
What's so good about him?

554
00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.140
Well...

555
00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:37.780
You set a precedent

556
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.180
to see His Lordship in the restaurant.

557
00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.220
Me?

558
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:46.460
Yes.

559
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:47.900
Before you were married

560
00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:49.580
to my cousin,

561
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.940
you were waiting for him

562
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.620
at the restaurant every day.

563
00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.420
If His Lordship ate here,

564
00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:55.460
you would come with him.

565
00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:57.180
In short,

566
00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.180
you went wherever

567
00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.050
His Lordship went.

568
00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.740
No way.

569
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.580
It couldn't be me.

570
00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.380
How can I do this kind of thing?

571
00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.460
Your Ladyship, looks like

572
00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.420
you've really lost your memory.

573
00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.220
Your Ladyship.

574
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.260
Let me tell you.

575
00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.260
Many people

576
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.220
in the capital

577
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.140
are obsessed with His Lordship.

578
00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:18.380
They will also go to the restaurants

579
00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.180
that His Lordship has been to.

580
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:19.980
They will also ask the waiters

581
00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:20.780
what His Lordship likes to eat,

582
00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:22.340
and then order the same.

583
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:23.300
Once,

584
00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:24.420
Miss Huang almost fell from upstairs

585
00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.900
in order to watch His Lordship

586
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.900
in the front row.

587
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:29.420
What's more,

588
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:30.740
Miss Li

589
00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:32.300
passed out

590
00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.540
because His Lordship accidentally

591
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.980
glanced at her last time.

592
00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.180
Your Ladyship.

593
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:38.860
What are you doing

594
00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:39.900
with these pictures?

595
00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.940
This is how I make money.

596
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:42.700
This...

597
00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:44.100
How to make money with them?

598
00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.260
Didn't you see

599
00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:47.100
how crazy the eyes

600
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.220
of those ladies were

601
00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.300
when they saw Ning Yuxuan today?

602
00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.260
So

603
00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:52.500
women like to

604
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.660
spend money

605
00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.340
on their favorite things.

606
00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:54.700
Right?

607
00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.140
Yes.

608
00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.260
I'm going to sell

609
00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:56.780
all these paintings.

610
00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.500
Sell His Lordship's portraits?

611
00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.420
Hush.

612
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.900
But, Your Ladyship,

613
00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:04.740
you have a deep love for His Lordship.

614
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.220
How could you sell them?

615
00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.620
Who has a deep love for him?

616
00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:11.900
Now he

617
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:12.780
can't wait to drive me out of

618
00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.860
Ning's Mansion as soon as possible.

619
00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:14.980
Since he is so cruel,

620
00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.020
don't blame me for being unrighteous.

621
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.500
Go tell Qian Lianxue that

622
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.900
we will go to Kuixing Restaurant

623
00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.900
again tomorrow.

624
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.900
Unexpectedly, I am so smart

625
00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:29.780
and thought of a way

626
00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:30.700
to make money so soon.

627
00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.260
He looks so handsome.

628
00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.460
It's a pity that

629
00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:39.580
he's a beast in human face.

630
00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.860
(Ning's Mansion)

631
00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.420
Hurry up.

632
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:47.460
Boss.

633
00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.060
The wife of Lackey Ning
is coming out.

634
00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.100
(Yuan Lang)
Whether our men in prison

635
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:53.980
can be rescued

636
00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.260
depends on the First Lady
of Ning's Mansion.

637
00:27:58.780 --> 00:27:59.220
Let's go.

638
00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.500
Everyone.

639
00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.420
Some time ago,

640
00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.100
I got a collection of essays

641
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.300
by Marquis Moyu.

642
00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.660
It's really well written.

643
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.620
Seriously?

644
00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.340
Of course.

645
00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:08.940
Let me take a look, Miss Song.

646
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:09.420
Show me.

647
00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.420
Right, show us.

648
00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.060
We all want to take a look.

649
00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:11.700
No worries.

650
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.220
I will bring it with me some day

651
00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.060
to open your eyes.

652
00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.940
It's well written.

653
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:17.460
Exactly.

654
00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.100
Miss Qian.

655
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.180
This is... Nie Sangyu?

656
00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:22.940
Right.

657
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.900
Boss, here she is.

658
00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:28.940
Nie Sangyu.

659
00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:30.220
Why are you here?

660
00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.260
Isn't this devil

661
00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.740
coming to kill?

662
00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.420
Kill?

663
00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:34.660
I'm afraid so.

664
00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.020
I heard that

665
00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:37.900
you are gathering here

666
00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:39.140
to see my husband.

667
00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.180
No!

668
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:42.460
- Exactly.
- How can we do this?

669
00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.700
Just admit it.

670
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.620
I am here today

671
00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:46.900
to relieve your lovesickness.

672
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:48.660
Everyone.

673
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:50.220
You are here

674
00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:51.420
all day just to

675
00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.500
take a glance at my husband.

676
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.420
Your infatuation is so touching.

677
00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.900
So today I specially

678
00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.540
brought you something good.

679
00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.300
What's so good?

680
00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:00.820
Muxu.

681
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:05.020
This is the portrait of Marquis Moyu.

682
00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:05.900
It's Marquis Moyu.

683
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.980
This is the picture of His Lordship
practicing martial arts.

684
00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:16.220
This is

685
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.700
the picture of His Lordship
handling the case.

686
00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:22.900
All kinds of styles are available.

687
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:23.860
I promise it's like

688
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:25.580
seeing him in real life.

689
00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:26.860
Right.

690
00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:28.140
Everyone.

691
00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:32.340
These two paintings

692
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.620
have been bought by others.

693
00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:34.820
Bought?

694
00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.220
Only this painting

695
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:36.620
is still for sale.

696
00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:38.460
The starting price is ten taels,
and the highest bidder wins.

697
00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:40.660
Ten taels?

698
00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.380
What to do?

699
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.700
So expensive.

700
00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.220
Who can afford it?

701
00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:44.940
Miss Huang.

702
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:47.380
Look carefully.

703
00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.100
The jade paper and pine smoke ink

704
00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.380
are extremely expensive.

705
00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:52.740
And look carefully.

706
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:53.900
Come here.

707
00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:55.180
Look at the painting art.

708
00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:56.860
Each of His Lordship's eyebrows,

709
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.660
hair,

710
00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:58.740
and even eyelashes

711
00:29:58.740 --> 00:29:59.980
come to life.

712
00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.060
The painting is so good that
it can be called out of print.

713
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.420
Shall we buy it?

714
00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.020
Furthermore,

715
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:06.300
the portrait has a price,

716
00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.460
but His Lordship is priceless.

717
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:09.300
However...

718
00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:10.740
Three.

719
00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:12.940
Two.

720
00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:18.260
One.

721
00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.740
Twenty taels.

722
00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:25.020
Thirty taels.

723
00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.460
- Fifty taels.
- Fifty taels.

724
00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.020
Fifty taels?

725
00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.300
How can fifty taels be enough

726
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:32.820
to buy the portrait of His Lordship?

727
00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:35.980
Eighty taels.

728
00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.260
It's too much!

729
00:30:37.260 --> 00:30:37.940
Miss Song.

730
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.020
This...

731
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.580
She went too far.

732
00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.980
Miss Song, eighty taels. Deal.

733
00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:43.940
Muxu, collect the money.

734
00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:44.380
Deal.

735
00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:47.180
Here you are.

736
00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.700
Take care.

737
00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.260
Your Ladyship, eighty taels.

738
00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.020
Mrs. Ning.

739
00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.580
Do you have any other paintings

740
00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.460
that can be ordered?

741
00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.300
Mrs. Ning.

742
00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.940
- I didn't expect you to be so generous.
- Indeed.

743
00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:00.380
You are completely different

744
00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.540
from the rumors.

745
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:02.380
Right.

746
00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:04.100
Interesting.

747
00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:05.900
Ning Yuxuan's wife

748
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.860
is using him to make money.

749
00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:08.300
Wait.

750
00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.540
(Zhao Hu, Zhao Long)

751
00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:10.740
Boss, why do you care about this

752
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.660
at this moment?

753
00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:12.900
They haven't left yet.

754
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.740
Let's catch them.

755
00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.060
Here comes

756
00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:15.980
an opportunity

757
00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.180
to directly contact Ning Yuxuan.

758
00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.140
Why don't we take advantage of it?

759
00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.300
Coming.

760
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.260
Thank you.

761
00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.300

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:55.420
Thank you.

772
00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:56.140
Thank you.

773
00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.620
(Bank notes)

774
00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.820
What a fortune tree.

775
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.820
Here, Miss Xue.

776
00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:03.900
It's yours.

777
00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.740
Wait, so much?

778
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.860
Just take it.

779
00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.020
We won the first battle

780
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:10.900
thanks to your help.

781
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:11.500
Besides,

782
00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.780
you deserve half of it.

783
00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:13.460
You are welcome.

784
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.740
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

785
00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.620
(The scar)

786
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.780
on Banxia's shoulder

787
00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.940
may need

788
00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:28.780
Scar Recovering Cream.

789
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.300
Sweet-scented osmanthus, 15 mace.

790
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.140
White poria, 10 mace.

791
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.060
Rose, 15 mace.

792
00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:49.860
Saffron crocus, 10 mace.

793
00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:51.460
Flos hibisci, 10 mace.

794
00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.260
Right.

795
00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.420
Done.

796
00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.900
This is what I call Scar Recovery Cream.

797
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:09.700
Apply it to the wound,

798
00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.700
and it will heal quickly.

799
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.820
It's so amazing.

800
00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.260
Right.

801
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.820
You can also apply it to your face.

802
00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:16.380
I guarantee

803
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:17.380
your face will be soft
and well-moisturized

804
00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.820
within a few days.

805
00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:20.780
Cool.

806
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.580
You know how to make this.

807
00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:23.740
Your Ladyship, but when

808
00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.780
did you learn it?

809
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:25.940
Didn't I know how to do it before?

810
00:33:26.100 --> 00:33:26.940
No.

811
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:31.020
Did I know how to cook before?

812
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.060
You didn't even know

813
00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:32.780
where the kitchen is.

814
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.780
You did hide your light under a bushel.

815
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.900
Amazing.

816
00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.900
- I didn't know how to cook...
- Scar Recovering Cream.

817
00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:38.980
Not even...

818
00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.740
Forget it.

819
00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:42.700
Let's quickly

820
00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.860
take this out

821
00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.500
and give it to Banxia.

822
00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:46.460
Ask her to

823
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:47.780
apply it to the scar

824
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:48.820
once in the morning and at night.

825
00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.260
In this way, I guarantee that

826
00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:50.980
it will be effective
within seven days.

827
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:52.460
You spent so much time

828
00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.820
collecting these medicinal materials

829
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.140
just for Banxia?

830
00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:57.580
You are giving such a good thing

831
00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.300
to a maid?

832
00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:01.660
After all, her injury

833
00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:02.860
was caused by me.

834
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:04.500
And...

835
00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.300
And

836
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.420
she's

837
00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:08.700
a blooming girl.

838
00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:10.780
If she gets a scar on her back,

839
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.420
I'll blame myself
for the rest of my life.

840
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.620
What?

841
00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.860
I just think

842
00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.780
you've really changed a lot.

843
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:23.580
You never thought about

844
00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.060
the feelings of servants

845
00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:26.100
like this before.

846
00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:28.660
I am no longer

847
00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:29.900
the original Nie Sangyu.

848
00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:30.780
I...

849
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.500
I have said that I want to

850
00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:33.420
turn over a new leaf.

851
00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:34.900
Your Ladyship, you are so kind.

852
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.060
Better ones are still on the way.

853
00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:36.660
Our

854
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.740
primary goal now

855
00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:38.980
is to make money as soon as possible.

856
00:34:38.980 --> 00:34:39.540
Make money!

857
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:41.740
Repeat

858
00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:42.540
what you just said.

859
00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.100
Who is the person behind you?

860
00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.260
I only know that

861
00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.580
his name is Lang

862
00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:48.860
and he is from the south.

863
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.100
A few months ago,

864
00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.220
he summoned bandits

865
00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:53.420
from many places

866
00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.580
to train,

867
00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.420
and gave them rewards every day.

868
00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:58.700
He made the plan

869
00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.180
for the assassination several days ago.

870
00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.460
Lang?

871
00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.300
What does he look like?
How old is he?

872
00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.380
I've never met him.

873
00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:09.980
He is

874
00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.340
very mysterious.

875
00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.020
I overheard someone say that

876
00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.820
he has a totem on his right arm.

877
00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.260
What kind of totem?

878
00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:26.580
It seems to be...

879
00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:29.860
It seems to be something
in the shape of a leaf.

880
00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.300
Where is he now?

881
00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.700
I really don't know this.

882
00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:35.460
I have no idea.

883
00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.140
Who else has seen him

884
00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.340
but you?

885
00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.380
No idea.

886
00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.940
I've said all I know.

887
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.380
Let me go.

888
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.380
I said everything.

889
00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.660
I mean it.

890
00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:48.700
- Let me go.
- Check it out.

891
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.340
Keep digging it.

892
00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:53.660
Boss.

893
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:57.900
Did it work?

894
00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:58.780
I learned about

895
00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.660
the situation in the prison.

896
00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:00.700
There is bad news.

897
00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.180
Lackey Ning interrogated them again.

898
00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:02.820
Someone

899
00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:03.580
has confessed

900
00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:04.300
your name Lang.

901
00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.060
Boss.

902
00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.580
What to do next?

903
00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:11.460
I don't care what method you use

904
00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.220
or how much you spend,

905
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.860
buy a chance

906
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:16.460
to eat with Lackey Ning.

907
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:17.860
Let me see.

908
00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:18.900
Let me see.

909
00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:19.740
I brought money with me

910
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.620
to buy it.

911
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:21.940
I have money with me.

912
00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.220
Everyone can have it.

913
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:23.820
Come on.

914
00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:25.220
One by one.

915
00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:27.700
I've taken out

916
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:28.340
the most precious things.

917
00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.340
This is a painting of His Lordship
practicing sword.

918
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:29.860
See?

919
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:30.820
So lively.

920
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:31.740
Thirty taels.

921
00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.260
Thirty taels.

922
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:34.860
There are more.

923
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:35.660
And this.

924
00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.220
This painting

925
00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.460
shows His Lordship drinking tea.

926
00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.020
Isn't this...

927
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:40.540
Here.

928
00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:41.540
Right here.

929
00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.060
Right here.

930
00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.460
Take a good look.

931
00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:44.620
Right?

932
00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.340
I got it.

933
00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.340
Miss Wang, this is for you.

934
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:49.300
Remember to pay.

935
00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:51.060
Take it.

936
00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:53.500
Here, it's for you.

937
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.260
Pay money.

938
00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.420
What's up?

939
00:36:56.980 --> 00:36:57.900
Are you looking for me?

940
00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.380
What's going on

941
00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.420
with these people outside?

942
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.740
You locked me up

943
00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:08.980
in Reflection Pavilion.

944
00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.780
They were worried about me,

945
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.820
so they came to visit me.

946
00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:12.820
I am

947
00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:13.780
so popular,

948
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.340
and I am too embarrassed
to refuse them.

949
00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:15.900
Right?

950
00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.420
With your reputation in the capital,

951
00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.620
how could anyone come to see you?

952
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:24.740
Right.

953
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:27.740
Don't you believe me?

954
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.580
If you...

955
00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.460
If you don't believe me,

956
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.820
I'll call them over.

957
00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:39.500
Fangfang, Caocao, Huahua.

958
00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:40.780
Come to see His Lordship.

959
00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.820
Greetings to Your Lordship.

960
00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:56.580
Your Lordship.

961
00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.500
Guards.

962
00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.180
Take them away.

963
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.700
I just came here.

964
00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:02.660
Why?

965
00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:03.380
Your Lordship.

966
00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:04.980
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

967
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.380
Please.

968
00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:06.820
Please.

969
00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:07.660
It's okay.

970
00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.340
Come back next time.

971
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:08.780
Please.

972
00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.460
Come back next time.

973
00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:09.900
No worries.

974
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:10.260
Go.

975
00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:10.860
I am going to take a look.

976
00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:11.980
Nie Sangyu.

977
00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.020
You think you've done it perfectly,

978
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:16.620
don't you?

979
00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.380
See for yourself what this is.

980
00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.300
How dare you

981
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.540
use me

982
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.740
to make money?

983
00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.340
What's this?

984
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.020
I...

985
00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:39.900
I don't know what
you're talking about.

986
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:40.900
Gui Bai.

987
00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.020
At seven o'clock in the morning,

988
00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.420
Minister Liu's second daughter

989
00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:46.740
and the third daughter
of the Wang family

990
00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:47.900
sneaked into the backyard

991
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.060
to watch His Lordship read,

992
00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.420
which was charged twenty taels.

993
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:51.460
At 11 o'clock in the morning,

994
00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:52.980
Ms. Huang and Ms. Song

995
00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.540
peeked at His Lordship in the martial arts
training ground.

996
00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:56.700
Muxu took 50 taels from them.

997
00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:57.860
All these were confessed

998
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.580
by First Lady's maid,

999
00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:01.980
Muxu.

1000
00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:04.660
Did you follow me?

1001
00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.500
How much did she charge in total?

1002
00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.100
A total of

1003
00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.980
325 taels for now.

1004
00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.260
Why are my taels here

1005
00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:17.500
with you?

1006
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.700
They were all confiscated.

1007
00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.060
The Marquis's Mansion will be
under martial law from now on.

1008
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.460
Outsiders are not allowed to enter.

1009
00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:24.300
No way.

1010
00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.340
It's my hard earned money.

1011
00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:27.660
You can't take it.

1012
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.220
Wait.

1013
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:32.620
Look.

1014
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:33.620
Well.

1015
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:35.860
What about this?

1016
00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.580
Let's talk.

1017
00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:38.620
Well...

1018
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:40.820
Fifty fifty?

1019
00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.260
I painted them by myself after all.

1020
00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.060
What about

1021
00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:49.620
forty sixty?

1022
00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.980
Or thirty seventy.

1023
00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.340
Twenty eighty.

1024
00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:56.100
You can't take any more.

1025
00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:56.940
Get out.

1026
00:39:58.900 --> 00:39:59.580
Wait.

1027
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.060
What about ten ninety?

1028
00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.010
Piss off!

1029
00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.900
Ruthless villain!

1030
00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:12.700
Miser!

1031
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:13.900
Your Ladyship, something's up!

1032
00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:14.580
Your Ladyship!

1033
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:15.540
Your Ladyship, something's up!

1034
00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:15.980
I know.

1035
00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.180
Gui Bai stole all the money.

1036
00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.220
Your Ladyship, not a penny is left.

1037
00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:20.460
I didn't expect him

1038
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.660
to be so cruel.

1039
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.260
Indeed.

1040
00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:25.900
Your Ladyship.

1041
00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.220
Just now...

1042
00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:28.420
My Lady

1043
00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:30.380
is willing to pay 500 taels

1044
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.500
for a chance

1045
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:33.220
to eat with His Lordship.

1046
00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:35.420
500... 500 tales

1047
00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:37.300
for a chance to eat with His Lordship?

1048
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.220
Are you serious?

1049
00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:43.940
Do you have any concerns?

1050
00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:45.380
Three days later,

1051
00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.460
My Lady will hold a banquet
at Kuixing Restaurant.

1052
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.500
Looking forward to His Lordship's coming.

1053
00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:52.380
Are you sure?

1054
00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.060
Totally sure.

1055
00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.260
I know that

1056
00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:59.700
there is always a way out.

1057
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:01.140
But

1058
00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.620
would His Lordship listen to you

1059
00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:03.820
and be there?

1060
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.300
I'll make every possible effort

1061
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.220
to find a way.

1062
00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:17.900
Really?

1063
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.300
I didn't expect you

1064
00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.100
to be useful.

1065
00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:32.980
Nice

1066
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:37.020
swordsmanship.

1067
00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.140
Amazing, Yuxuan.

1068
00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:42.100
Awesome.

1069
00:41:44.020 --> 00:41:44.740
Yuxuan.

1070
00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:46.980
I have something
to discuss with you.

1071
00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.540
Dr. Li said that

1072
00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:49.340
if I did something

1073
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:50.460
that I had done before,

1074
00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:52.060
it would help to
restore my memory.

1075
00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:52.780
I heard that

1076
00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.700
I often

1077
00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:54.620
watched you eat

1078
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.460
at Kuixing Restaurant.

1079
00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:56.460
I think

1080
00:41:56.460 --> 00:41:57.260
this is a good opportunity.

1081
00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:57.780
Maybe

1082
00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.500
if we go there again,

1083
00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:59.700
I'll remember everything.

1084
00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:01.660
I officially inform you today that

1085
00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.460
I have made a reservation

1086
00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:03.060
at Kuixing Restaurant.

1087
00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:03.980
Come with me

1088
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:04.860
in three days.

1089
00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:05.380
