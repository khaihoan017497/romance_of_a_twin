- Stop!
- Don't let her get away.

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.030
Hunt her down.

Stop!

14
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.470
Stop! Come on.

(Nie Sangyu)

16
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.350
Nie Sangyu.

(Ning Yuxuan)

18
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.230
Miss Wen's life is uncertain.

19
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.350
Go back with me.

20
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.510
I didn't kill her!

21
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.920
I told you!

22
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.560
Ning Yuxuan.

23
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.760
We've been married for four years.

24
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.480
Why are you pushing me so hard?

25
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.640
I will say it one last time.

26
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.560
Go back.

27
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.430
Lovebirds got separated.

28
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.000
The mirror was broken.

29
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.470
A couple left each other.

30
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.030
My husband.

31
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.710
I curse you for

32
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.910
a lifetime of despair

33
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.870
and pain

34
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:41.960
like mine,

35
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.400
with a tragic end.

36
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.190
Nie Sangyu.

37
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.360
What are you going to do?

38
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.910
Nie Sangyu!

39
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.590
(My hair just covered my forehead,)

40
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.630
(and I folded flowers in front of the door.)

41
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.120
(You came here on horseback,)

42
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.030
(while I was playing with
green plum blossoms.)

43
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.190
(When I married you at 14 years old,)

44
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.400
(I was too shy to smile.)

45
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.680
(I only stretched my eyebrows
at the age of 15,)

46
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.150
(willing to be with you forever.)

47
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.800
(When I was 16,)

48
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.280
(you left home on a long journey
to Yanyudui in Qutang Gorge.)

50

51
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.500
(Ning's Mansion)

52
00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.270
(Madam, you woke up.)

53
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.950
Great.

54
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.870
Yes, take the medicine.

55
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.600
Miss, who are you?

56
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:57.600
Muxu.

57
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.480
Muxu?

58
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.510
I am your personal maid,

59
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.680
(Muxu)
Muxu, Your Ladyship.

60
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.560
Your Ladyship?

61
00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.720
Yes.

62
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.070
You are the First Lady

63
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.070
of Marquis Moyu's Mansion.

64
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:21.630
Your Ladyship.

65
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.000
Don't you like

66
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.430
my name?

67
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.360
Your Ladyship, don't get angry.

68
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.310
If you don't like it,

69
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.480
just change my name.

70
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.950
Celery, Leek, and the like.

71
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.630
Everything will do.

72
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.360
Don't get angry.

73
00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.360
Don't get angry.

74
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.740
Wait, Miss.

75
00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.460
Don't get angry, Your Ladyship.

76
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.600
- Don't do this. Get up.
- Don't get angry.

77
00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.040
Get up. Come on.

78
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:39.360
Well, the Marquis's Mansion

79
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.390
and the First Lady you said

80
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.870
have nothing to do with me.

81
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.240
Did you make a mistake?

82
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.630
Your Ladyship.

83
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.240
You seem to be different.

84
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.310
Could it be that you broke your brain

85
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.630
when you fell off the cliff?

86
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.950
Fell off the cliff?

87
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.480
Who fell off the cliff?

88
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.750
So crazy.

89
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.560
Miss.

90
00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.430
You seem to be occupied.

91
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.950
I am also busy.

92
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.070
I have to go.

93
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:20.720
You can't get out.

94
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.040
There are so many people
guarding outside.

95
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.600
Why?

96
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.000
That's because you did...

97
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.310
You did something wrong.

98
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:30.630
That's why you are locked up.

99
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:40.950
Marquis has ordered

100
00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.190
no one to come or go.

101
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.720
I'll just leave for a while.

102
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.360
Okay.

103
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.240
I'm not leaving.

104
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.830
Be nice.

105
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:56.600
I'm not going out.

106
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.270
Don't worry.

107
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.510
Look.

108
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.600
We need to think long term

109
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.390
about this matter.

110
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.270
I fell off a cliff.

111
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.390
Then here I am.

112
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.390
Yes.

113
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.040
Then why did I fall off the cliff?

114
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.920
What happened

115
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.430
before this?

116
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.630
I dare not say.

117
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.950
Why not?

118
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.750
You asked me to say it.

119
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.270
Say it.

120
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:25.630
It all started

121
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.070
with a chicken.

122
00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.040
A chicken?

123
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.910
(You came here on horseback,)

124
00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:36.120
(while I was playing with
green plum blossoms.)

125
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.600
(Ning's Mansion, Capital)
(When I married you at 14 years old,)

126
00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.440
(I was too shy to smile.)

127
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.670
Get out of the way.

128
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.960
(Banxia)
Mr. Liu. Mr. Liu.

129
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.000
Why are you back so late?

130
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.240
Her Ladyship is waiting anxiously.

131
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.630
Okay.

132
00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:46.750
Take it in now.

133
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.240
Excuse me. Excuse me.

134
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.790
I don't know

135
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.360
what Her Ladyship is up to.

136
00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.510
What did I want a chicken for?

137
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:57.910
Your name is Nie Sangyu,

138
00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.790
the eldest daughter of

139
00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:00.320
General Zhenyuan Nie Xiangyuan.

140
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.630
You fell in love with Marquis Moyu
Ning Yuxuan at first sight

141
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.200
and insisted on marrying him.

142
00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.000
And

143
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.870
you have a sobriquet.

144
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.270
No.1 She-devil of the Capital.

145
00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.200
She-devil?

146
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.960
Coming.

147
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.910
Take it out and show me.

148
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.390
Yes, Your Ladyship.

149
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.480
Come out.

150
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.630
Come out.

151
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:34.150
Come...

152
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.910
You!

153
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.360
How dare you!

154
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.720
If you hurt the chicken,

155
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.960
you can't pay for your life.

156
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.360
It's all my fault.

157
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.440
Your Ladyship, please show me mercy.

158
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.840
Okay.

159
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:50.320
Someone.

160
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.120
Reward Banxia

161
00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:54.360
with my plum blossom picture

162
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:55.910
as a flower seal.

163
00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.030
Your Ladyship.

164
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.480
Your Ladyship, please spare me!

165
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:01.510
Your Ladyship!

166
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.270
(Your Ladyship!)

167
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.360
(Your Ladyship, please spare me!)

168
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.670
(Your Ladyship, please spare me!)

169
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.030
(Marquis, Miss Xue!)

170
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.480
(Save me!)

171
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:13.440
(Your Ladyship, please spare me!)

172
00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.750
(Marquis, Miss Xue!)

173
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.030
Where is the Marquis?

174
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.080
(Save me!)

175
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.240
Is the bird's nest

176
00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.000
in the kitchen still warm?

177
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.750
(Miss Xue!)

178
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.910
I'm asking you.

179
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.790
Your Ladyship, no worries.

180
00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.840
Marquis has gone to the Politics Hall,

181
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.790
and may not be back until later.

182
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.790
You can have a meal first.

183
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.030
No.

184
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.360
(Save me!)

185
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.550
I'm going to wait for him to come back.

186
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.550
So horrible.

187
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.790
No, let's not talk about this.

188
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.270
Something else.

189
00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:58.150
Tell me about my husband.

190
00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.600
What kind of person is he?

191
00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.670
Marquis devotes himself
to government affairs

192
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.550
and spends most of his time
in the Politics Hall.

193
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:04.200
Moreover,

194
00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:05.320
he achieves success when young,

195
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.750
and is the Left Consul
of the present dynasty.

196
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.670
He's also No. 1 Handsome Man
of the Capital.

197
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:18.020
(Central Secretariat)

198
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.940
(Politics Hall)

199
00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:28.600
Sir.

200
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:29.910
This is the relevant document

201
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.270
compiled on the case of

202
00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:32.320
(From Minister of Water, Lu Wenbin)
flood prevention and control in the southeast.

203
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.550
Please take a look.

204
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.750
Flood prevention and control?

205
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.720
It is the flood season,

206
00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:38.840
and floods broke out frequently.

207
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.390
(From Minister of Water, Lu Wenbin)
The stricken people are suffering.

208
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.480
However, disaster relief matters

209
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.910
involve a wide range of issues,
and implementation is slow.

210
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.000
So I think

211
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.960
it's better to plan early.

212
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.670
Taking precautions

213
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.030
is indeed a must.

214
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.670
Mr. Ning, you are really thoughtful.

215
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.670
I'm flattered.

216
00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.270
By the way, sir.

217
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.550
I have a presumptuous request.

218
00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.630
Go ahead.

219
00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.750
I have to take three days off

220
00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:01.670
due to my marriage.

221
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.630
By then, you and

222
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.750
my colleagues

223
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.360
are invited to attend.

224
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.150
Approved.

225
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:07.030
Just go.

226
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.360
Thank you, sir.

227
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.750
(Self-discipline for Justice)

228
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:10.390
Mr. Liu.

229
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.320
The Ministry of Justice
urgently reported that

230
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.870
a group of bandits appeared
in the south of the city.

231
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.390
Bandits?

232
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.270
Yes.

233
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:18.390
How come?

234
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.870
So he is a good officer.

235
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:14.720
You have done so many evil things.

236
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.840
Do you really think you can escape
the punishment of the law?

237
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.080
There are so many choices

238
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.750
in the world,

239
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:24.150
but you became a bandit
who brings troubles to people.

240
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.080
Now that you are a bandit,

241
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.840
you should have expected today.

242
00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.150
It seems that my husband

243
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:41.480
is a decisive bandit-suppressing hero.

244
00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.510
There must be many girls

245
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.080
who like him.

246
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.750
Right.

247
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.320
Yesterday was the day

248
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.270
when Marquis married

249
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:52.840
his second wife.

250
00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:53.870
Second wife?

251
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:55.030
He has me.

252
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.960
Why did he get married again?

253
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:57.960
Marquis took a concubine
for the first time

254
00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.150
after four years of marriage.

255
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:02.000
You must be sad, Your Ladyship.

256
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:05.270
Listen.

257
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.630
Good-looking men

258
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.670
are all philandering.

259
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.670
Is everything arranged at home?

260
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.750
Yes.

261
00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:13.030
(Gui Bai)
The guards on patrol have doubled.

262
00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:13.630
Our people will be placed

263
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.000
among the guests.

264
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.480
In the process of encircling
and suppressing bandits over the years,

265
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.360
there are many escaped criminals.

266
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.200
Today is my wedding day.

267
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.720
I hope they don't miss

268
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.320
the chance for revenge.

269
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:32.390
(Your Lordship.)

270
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:32.870
(Your Ladyship.)

271
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.480
(Your Lordship.)

272
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:34.630
(Marquis doesn't allow anyone to enter.)

273
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.600
Your Ladyship, you can't get in.

274
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.320
Your Ladyship. Your Ladyship.

275
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.030
You can't get in.

276
00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:37.510
Your Ladyship, you can't get in.

277
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.120
Your Ladyship.

278
00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.030
Your Ladyship.

279
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.390
Marquis said you can't get in.

280
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:41.270
Don't get in.

281
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.150
Are you really going to marry her?

282
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.840
Gui Bai.

283
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:50.840
Is this your deployment?

284
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.390
Anyone can break in.

285
00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.390
I disagree.

286
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.960
I don't allow you to marry her.

287
00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.360
Go back to your room.

288
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:04.480
I am the hostess of this mansion.

289
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.240
I don't allow you to marry her.

290
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.200
Someone.

291
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.000
Take First Lady back to the room.

292
00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.030
She'll be grounded today.

293
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.440
Yes, sir.

294
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:15.440
Ning Yuxuan!

295
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:16.480
No! Ning Yuxuan!

296
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.270
Your Ladyship, let's go.

297
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:17.910
Ning Yuxuan!

298
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.390
You can't marry her.

299
00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:20.270
Ning Yuxuan!

300
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.120
Don't touch me!

301
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.360
Remember.

302
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.910
I am the hostess of the mansion.

303
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.440
It seems that the relationship

304
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:50.630
between us isn't good at all,

305
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:52.630
is it?

306
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.270
Now that he went to
suppress the bandits,

307
00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:57.440
who would pick up the bride?

308
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.320
(Wen's Mansion)
The bride is out.

309
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:27.790
Where is Marquis?

310
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.390
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

311
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:30.550
Marquis...

312
00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.440
Marquis has something important to do

313
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.550
and can't make it here.

314
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:34.790
At the order

315
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:36.390
of the First Lady,

316
00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.720
I came to pick up the Second Lady.

317
00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.510
You alone?

318
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.480
Not me.

319
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.440
That's it.

320
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:51.510
How can you get a cock
to pick up the bride?

321
00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.080
Why would I force her

322
00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.750
to marry a cock?

323
00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.440
Because you were like that

324
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.030
back then.

325
00:16:58.630 --> 00:16:59.510
Back then...

326
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.630
I was like that?

327
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.880
I held a wedding ceremony
with a chicken?

328
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.110
What about the wedding after that?

329
00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.680
Here comes the bride.

330
00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.550
Here comes the bride.

331
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:21.350
Here comes the bride.

332
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.070
It's easy to mix in today.

333
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.750
Ning's Mansion's patrol

334
00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.790
shouldn't be so loose.

335
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.110
It's Lackey Ning's wedding day.

336
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.640
He must have been negligent.

337
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.550
Ask our people to be careful.

338
00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.110
Okay.

339
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.960
Just in case.

340
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.240
Here comes Mr. Ning.

341
00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.620
(Wen Wan)

342
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:12.750
Your Lordship, here you are.

343
00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:13.750
Let's get started.

344
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.590
Here.

345
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.440
Now is the auspicious time.

346
00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.000
Groom and bride.

347
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.270
The first kowtow is
for heaven and earth.

348
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.160
Ning Yuxuan!

349
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.750
Wait, Your Ladyship.

350
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:26.680
Here comes the First Lady.

351
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:28.160
With me here,

352
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:29.550
you can never marry her.

353
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.680
Nie Sangyu.

354
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.640
Watch your behavior.

355
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.350
I don't care.

356
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.110
Since we can't be a couple

357
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.510
in this life,

358
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:36.750
no one else can think about it.

359
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:37.720
Mr. Liu.

360
00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:38.830
Go ahead.

361
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.200
Groom and bride.

362
00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.440
The first kowtow is
for heaven and earth.

363
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.590
Okay.

364
00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.350
You forced me to do so.

365
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.750
Wen Wan!

366
00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:14.830
Call the doctor.

367
00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:16.440
Call the doctor!

368
00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.200
Call the doctor!

369
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.310
Nie Sangyu.

370
00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:19.200
It's not me!

371
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.030
Lackey Ning.

372
00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.070
Go to hell!

373
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.200
It's not me!

374
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:37.590
Here you are!

375
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.030
Wen Wan!

376
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.310
- Your Lordship, watch out!
- Gui Bai!

377
00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.000
Let's go!

378
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:10.750
Don't let go any of them.

379
00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:11.400
Yes!

380
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.830
Did Miss Wen

381
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.030
just die?

382
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:15.720
No. No.

383
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.310
Miss Wen wasn't stabbed
in the vital part.

384
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.750
She is recuperating in the mansion.

385
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:20.960
That's good.

386
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.790
I think that

387
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.680
you must have hurt your brain

388
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.440
when you fell off the cliff.

389
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.830
I'll get you the medicine.

390
00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.770
Maybe the memory will come back

391
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:27.830
after you take it.

392
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.790
Hold on.

393
00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:31.160
No worries about taking medicine.

394
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.070
My top priority now is

395
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:34.720
trying to escape.

396
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.750
(Your Ladyship.)

397
00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:42.070
Your Ladyship.

398
00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.000
Marquis asked you to the study.

399
00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.240
Marquis?

400
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.440
I'm not going.

401
00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:56.960
Muxu.

402
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:58.680
You just said that

403
00:20:59.030 --> 00:20:59.830
he's No. 1 Handsome Man

404
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.070
of the Capital, right?

405
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:05.440
Have you caught all the bandits

406
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:06.440
who assassinated at the wedding?

407
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:07.160
Your Lordship.

408
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:08.920
Three of them escaped.

409
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.070
Check out those caught ones.

410
00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.400
If I'm right,

411
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:16.510
it must have something to do
with the Tea Gang.

412
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.350
Yes.

413
00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.510
Marquis.

414
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.590
Here comes the First Lady.

415
00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.790
Your Lordship.

416
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.070
Here comes the First Lady.

417
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.240
Leave us alone.

418
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.030
Yes.

419
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.030
Honey.

420
00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.700
(A gentleman should also constantly
pursue progress just like nature.)

421
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.220
♪The singing and dancing
in the palace garden is over♪

422
00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.730
♪The bright moon shines
on the sad wanderers♪

423
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:17.180
♪Admiring the flowers in a lonely boat,
and the flowers remain the same♪

424
00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:22.100
♪After a rain, the chill is gone♪

425
00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.480
(His gentle appearance)

426
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.270
(is not as sinister)

427
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.510
(as Muxu described.)

428
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.070
(Maybe my relationship with him)

429
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.400
(is not so bad.)

430
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.750
Nie Sangyu.

431
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:46.510
Honey.

432
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.510
I heard

433
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.240
there was some misunderstanding

434
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:50.110
between us.

435
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.270
But I believe that

436
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.200
it won't affect

437
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:53.070
our relationship, right?

438
00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.000
Nie Sangyu.

439
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.480
Your crime of disturbing

440
00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.480
the Ning's Mansion is unforgivable.

441
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:00.880
Stop.

442
00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.310
I know what you're going to say.

443
00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.550
That's why

444
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.400
I feel wronged.

445
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:12.350
None of these things

446
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.550
was done by me.

447
00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.550
Are you acting enough?

448
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:20.830
I wasn't acting.

449
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:22.120
Do you need me

450
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:23.590
to remind you

451
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.070
how you broke into the wedding banquet

452
00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.070
and assassinated Wen Wan?

453
00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.480
I really

454
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.720
can't remember these.

455
00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:32.790
You are my husband.

456
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.920
You have to do me justice.

457
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.720
(Don't judge anyone by appearance.)

458
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.720
(His personality is terrible.)

459
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.480
It's possible that

460
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:45.160
I lost my mind

461
00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:46.550
after falling off the cliff.

462
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.590
I'll go back and think about it.

463
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:49.880
Stop!

464
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.000
(Statement of Confession)
Sign it.

465
00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:00.540
What's this?

466
00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:03.740
Statement of Confession?

467
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:06.860
The criminal Nie Sangyu

468
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.180
did violence and abused servants.

469
00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.580
Her methods are vicious
and her crimes are serious.

470
00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.860
She voluntarily moves to
Reflection Pavilion to repent,

471
00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.100
and promises to

472
00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.900
spend the rest of her life
in the Marquis's Mansion.

473
00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:22.820
If she commits the crime again,

474
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.780
she will be at Ning Yuxuan's disposal.

475
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.460
(He looks so handsome.)

476
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.500
(But he's so evil-minded.)

477
00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.340
I can't sign it.

478
00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.780
For the sake of the four years
of our marriage,

479
00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:46.780
you only need to sign
the statement of confession,

480
00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.260
move into Reflection Pavilion,

481
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:49.460
and spend the rest of your life there

482
00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.540
from now on.

483
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.260
Why should I admit to

484
00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.780
something I haven't done?

485
00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:57.220
Sign the statement of confession.

486
00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.460
This is your only chance.

487
00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.500
I won't sign it.

488
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:20.900
Nie Sangyu.

489
00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.460
Sign it or not?

490
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.220
What are you going to do?

491
00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.460
I have interrogated
more than a thousand prisoners.

492
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.180
Tricks like faking a faint

493
00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.460
are long outdated.

494
00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:54.820
I can't admit it.

495
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:55.820
I didn't do it.

496
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.860
Stop challenging my patience.

497
00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.940
I will give you

498
00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.300
one last chance.

499
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:01.700
Sign the statement of confession,

500
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.940
and move into Reflection Pavilion.

501
00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.100
(Since my acting doesn't work,)

502
00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.140
(I have no choice but to...)

503
00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.420
I heard before that

504
00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:19.540
you are the Left Consul

505
00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.900
who is famous all over the capital.

506
00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:22.300
Then

507
00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:23.660
if everyone knows that

508
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.140
you have a sinful woman
as your legal wife,

509
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.540
what should they think of you?

510
00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.620
I can't do that.

511
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:30.420
Everyone in the capital

512
00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:31.340
knows your reputation,

513
00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.060
Nie Sangyu.

514
00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.500
I don't care anymore.

515
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:37.540
Wait...

516
00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.100
I don't care if you're playing the fool

517
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:40.700
or you've really lost your memory,

518
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:43.660
what's done is done.

519
00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:45.020
You can't deny it.

520
00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.220
A day together as a couple

521
00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.540
means endless devotion.

522
00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.860
- We've never spent a day together.
- For the sake of...

523
00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.300
Could it be that

524
00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.420
you are still...

525
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.740
You are still...

526
00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.580
Sign the statement of confession.

527
00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.740
This is the last time I'll say it.

528
00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.540
(It seems that if I don't
sign the statement of confession,)

529
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:12.100
(I can't leave here.)

530
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.260
(Forget it.)

531
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:14.500
(Just sign it.)

532
00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:18.420
I will sign it.

533
00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.060
Why so angry?

534
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.340
Okay, done.

535
00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:30.820
I will move to the Reflection Pavilion.

536
00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.340
Nie Sangyu!

537
00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.580
I promised to sign it.

538
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:48.060
But I didn't say what to sign.

539
00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.220
(Reflection Pavilion)

540
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.940
After moving into
the Reflection Pavilion,

541
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.860
we are done.

542
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.700
Your Ladyship.

543
00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:40.420
What's this?

544
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:41.940
This...

545
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.220
What if...

546
00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.020
What if we

547
00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.460
can't leave here anymore?

548
00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.580
Marquis really asked us

549
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:50.980
to stay here?

550
00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.660
Now that Marquis asked us to stay here,

551
00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.580
let's live a good life here

552
00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:00.140
as he expected.

553
00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:01.740
Your Ladyship.

554
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.380
Didn't you use to hate

555
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.860
these dirty and shabby places
the most?

556
00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.540
You had to bypass these places

557
00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:07.580
when you got out in a sedan chair.

558
00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.580
Since

559
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.420
we are already here,

560
00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.420
take things as they come.

561
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:19.980
Muxu.

562
00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.580
Listen.

563
00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:23.740
Put it

564
00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:24.860
here.

565
00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.260
Here.

566
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:28.980
Come back

567
00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:29.820
in six hours,

568
00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:30.660
okay?

569
00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:42.740
Your Ladyship.

570
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.020
Stop.

571
00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.420
The ground is slippery with water.

572
00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.740
I'll be done right away.

573
00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:50.780
No worries.

574
00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.740
Are you still the same person?

575
00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:55.900
Your Ladyship.

576
00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:56.620
You have never done

577
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.260
this kind of manual labor before.

578
00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.060
Why are you doing better than me?

579
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:01.860
If I don't hurry up,

580
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.260
where shall we live tonight?

581
00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.500
Your Ladyship.

582
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:06.100
Let me serve you a glass of water.

583
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:06.740
No need.

584
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:07.700
Put it there.

585
00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:08.900
I am not thirsty.

586
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.220
Your Ladyship.

587
00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.540
Don't be like this.

588
00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.900
I'm afraid.

589
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.420
You weren't like this before.

590
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.340
What's wrong, Muxu?

591
00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.580
What's going on?

592
00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:24.820
I may not have been like this before.

593
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.580
But

594
00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:26.980
from today on,

595
00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:27.900
I am

596
00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.020
who I am now.

597
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.580
It will never change.

598
00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:33.420
But...

599
00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.700
I know

600
00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.500
I've done a lot of things in the past

601
00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:38.780
that even made myself

602
00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.580
feel unbelievable.

603
00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:42.540
But I promise you that

604
00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:43.580
I will never

605
00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:44.700
let you live in fear

606
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:45.940
from now on.

607
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.780
Could you trust me?

608
00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:50.340
I trust you.

609
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:53.540
Your Ladyship, let's have dinner.

610
00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.260
The dinner is here?

611
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.540
Take it out.

612
00:30:58.820 --> 00:30:59.420
Come on.

613
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.740
Anything delicious?

614
00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:01.900
Here.

615
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:04.980
One more.

616
00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:05.900
More?

617
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:06.620
Here.

618
00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.020
Please eat.

619
00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:13.900
That's all?

620
00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.020
That's all.

621
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.220
No meat?

622
00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:17.500
Meat?

623
00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:19.860
You have been a vegetarian
for many years

624
00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.500
to pray for Marquis.

625
00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.420
I have also been vegetarian

626
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.300
with you for a long time.

627
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.140
I have been vegetarian
for him for many years?

628
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.020
I...

629
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.380
I love him that much?

630
00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.260
Regardless of whether
you are a vegetarian or not,

631
00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.860
Marquis specially ordered that

632
00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:40.180
those who came to Reflection Pavilion

633
00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.780
can only have this kind of meal.

634
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.500
Your Ladyship.

635
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.860
Don't be upset.

636
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:47.540
Right now,

637
00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:48.620
you'd better eat more

638
00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.540
and conserve your strength.

639
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:49.940
Only in this way

640
00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:50.940
can we have a chance

641
00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.220
to turn over.

642
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:55.060
You are right.

643
00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.420
Beggars

644
00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:58.780
can't be choosers.

645
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:00.140
To conserve strength.

646
00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:00.860
Eat!

647
00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:02.180
Eat!

648
00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.900
I'll serve you dishes.

649
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:05.580
Okay.

650
00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.380
Here, eat more.

651
00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.220
It's really not like her.

652
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.380
When you rescued her

653
00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.780
back then,

654
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.740
were you sure it was her?

655
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:21.940
Absolutely sure.

656
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.380
I can never

657
00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.060
mistake Her Ladyship.

658
00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.180
You mean

659
00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:31.980
Lady never scolded you before.

660
00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.060
She had great respect for you before.

661
00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.900
But now she's so bold.

662
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:38.980
Look at the font.

663
00:32:40.410 --> 00:32:41.980
Nie Sangyu has studied lower script
since she was a child,

664
00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:42.820
and her characters are delicate.

665
00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.780
But these profound and powerful words

666
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:46.900
cannot be written

667
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.540
without more than ten years of practice.

668
00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.060
What's

669
00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.620
Nie Sangyu up to?

670
00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:26.980
(There should be something inside.)

671
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.140
What?

672
00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.380
In the huge Ning's Mansion,

673
00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.500
there is not even food in the pot.

674
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.740
So many goodies.

675
00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.140
I'm so amazing.

676
00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:23.820
It's not burnt.

677
00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:40.300
I can't call for help.

678
00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.140
I can't call for help.

679
00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.540
Why is the fire growing stronger?

680
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:53.940
There's no need to do this for a meal.

681
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:54.620
I'd better run.

682
00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.500
Who locked the door?

683
00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:10.820
Open the door! Help!

684
00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.060
Fire!

685
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:15.820
Fire!

686
00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:16.580
Fire!

687
00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:17.180
Fire!

688
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:18.260
Fire! Put out the fire!

689
00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.420
Put out the fire!

690
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.940
Come on.

691
00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.540
Go get more water.

692
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:24.820
I'll go get some water.

693
00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:25.580
Come on! Water!

694
00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.380
Over there!

695
00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.140
If I had known earlier...

696
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.340
If I had known earlier,

697
00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.340
I might as well have died
falling off a cliff yesterday.

698
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.500
I was about to die in a fire

699
00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:34.420
just one day after
coming back to life.

700
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.100
Come on. Over there.

701
00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.900
Okay, coming.

702
00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:39.060
Here, come on.

703
00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:49.060
Come on.

704
00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:52.340
Your Lordship.

705
00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.140
Your Lordship.

706
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.100
The fire is fierce here.

707
00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:55.700
Go back first and I'll take care of it.

708
00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:56.260
Your Lordship.

709
00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.500
The kitchen was on fire

710
00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:58.660
when we got here.

711
00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.660
If it goes on,

712
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.020
the whole mansion will be burnt down.

713
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:03.420
Ask someone to tear it down.

714
00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:03.860
Yes, sir.

715
00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:04.700
Tear it down.

716
00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.140
Okay.

717
00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:05.940
Save me!

718
00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:06.820
Get ready to tear it down.

719
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:08.420
Anyone there?

720
00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:11.100
Save me!

721
00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:12.780
Save me!

722
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:13.700
Someone's inside.

723
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:14.500
Hurry up!

724
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.420
Someone's there.

725
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:17.150
Your Lordship, what are you going to do?

726
00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.420
You have always been
most afraid of fire.

727
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:19.380
Step aside.

728
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:19.860
No.

729
00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:21.260
Step aside.

730
00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.100
Your Lordship!

731
00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.380
Gui Bai!

732
00:37:58.540 --> 00:37:59.060
Your Lordship!

733
00:37:59.220 --> 00:37:59.900
Your Lordship!

734
00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:00.740
Your Ladyship.

735
00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:01.780
Here.

736
00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:04.700
Take care.

737
00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.940
Your Lordship, are you okay?

738
00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:10.900
So you were outside?

739
00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.300
I just yelled for a long time.

740
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.140
I thought there was no...

741
00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.420
Nie Sangyu!

742
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.500
You performed an assassination
at the wedding last time.

743
00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:18.900
And you set fire this time.

744
00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.020
Do you want everyone in the mansion

745
00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.260
to die with you?

746
00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.580
I was locked inside.

747
00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.180
I didn't set the fire.

748
00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:25.500
Then why are you here

749
00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:26.580
dressed like this?

750
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:31.740
Your Lordship.

751
00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:33.220
What's wrong with you?

752
00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:35.060
Piss off!

753
00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:36.540
You are injured.

754
00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:37.340
Take me away.

755
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:37.860
Yes.

756
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:39.740
Where are you hurt?

757
00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.860
Where are you hurt?

758
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.060
More water.

759
00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.620
Your Lordship.

760
00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:07.940
What's wrong with you?

761
00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:09.740
Piss off!

762
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.620
Your Ladyship, your soothing tea.

763
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:21.260
Muxu.

764
00:39:21.420 --> 00:39:22.020
Do you know

765
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:22.860
why Ning Yuxuan

766
00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:23.980
suddenly became like that?

767
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:27.900
I have no idea.

768
00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:29.460
But

769
00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.140
I think

770
00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.620
Marquis cares about you very much.

771
00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:32.180
Otherwise,

772
00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:32.900
he wouldn't have rushed into the fire

773
00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.060
to save you.

774
00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:38.340
It makes sense.

775
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.860
He looks fierce.

776
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:42.140
But he still has a conscience.

777
00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.340
You were frightened today.

778
00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.660
Go to bed earlier.

779
00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.180
I'm going to lock the door now.

780
00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.060
Wait.

781
00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.180
What's wrong, Your Ladyship?

782
00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.660
The kitchen door

783
00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:54.900
was locked by someone.

784
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.620
Someone wanted to kill me.

785
00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:04.460
Your Lordship.

786
00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.420
Your symptoms flared up again.

787
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:07.940
How about I go get a doctor?

788
00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:08.860
No need.

789
00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.180
I know what to do.

790
00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:11.780
Your Lordship.

791
00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.940
You are only curbing the disease

792
00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:14.780
by dousing yourself
in ice water like this.

793
00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:15.980
The disease cannot be eradicated.

794
00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.460
Habit cures habit.

795
00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.420
Get out.

796
00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.420
Out!

797
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:26.580
Yes, sir.

798
00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:44.700
Save me!

799
00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.300
Dad!

800
00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:51.940
(It's been so many years.)

801
00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.780
(Why am I still so afraid of fire?)

802
00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:57.780
(When exactly)

803
00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.980
(can I overcome the demon inside?)

804
00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:03.500
Dad!

805
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.180
Dad!

806
00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.340
Ning Yuxuan.

807
00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.980
Ning Yuxuan, it's me.

808
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.860
Listen.

809
00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.060
I think what happened in the kitchen...

810
00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:28.100
Put on your clothes.

811
00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.220
I didn't mean to

812
00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:30.300
watch you take a bath.

813
00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.260
I'm not interested

814
00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.940
even if you're naked.

815
00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:41.180
I'll count to three.

816
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.340
Put on your clothes.

817
00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:45.740
One.

818
00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.140
Two.

819
00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.740
I'm turning around.

820
00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.220
