00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.980
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.570
Leave the Ning's Mansion.

4
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.130
Make money even if she's lying down.

5
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.210
Gui Bai,

6
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.290
are you sure the person
you fished out that day

7
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.800
was Nie Sangyu?

8
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.440
Absolutely sure.

9
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.130
Could there be

10
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.720
two people

11
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.010
who look exactly the same?

12
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.040
It can't be that coincident, can it?

13
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.090
Even the second daughter
of the Nie family

14
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.290
doesn't have the same face

15
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.370
as Her Ladyship's.

16
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.010
She's still what she used to be,

17
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.970
but

18
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.690
she just looks totally different.

19
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.920
Her Ladyship is very furious now.

20
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.130
Should we tell her the truth?

21
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.760
Even if she knows that, so what?

22
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.440
She can never

23
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.640
leave the Ning's Mansion
for her whole life,

24
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.760
so we don't need to burn daylight.

25
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.880
Sangyu.

26
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.600
Sangyu.

27
00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.290
- Miss Wen.
- Sangyu.

28
00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.600
Hello.

29
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.040
Can you walk now?

30
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.720
Have you got better?

31
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.850
Yes... Yes.

32
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.810
How could the maids

33
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.530
be so

34
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.160
cruel?

35
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.880
Sangyu,

36
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760
I feel distressed for you.

37
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.530
But

38
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.530
you can't propose divorcing

39
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.010
His Lordship peacefully

40
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.970
no matter

41
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.090
how angry you are.

42
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.600
You are his first wife,

43
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.850
so you should bear

44
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.570
whatever grievance it is.

45
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.970
Stop.

46
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.530
If you continue mentioning him

47
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.370
or persuading me,

48
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.720
you should stop trying now.

49
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.290
I've made my decision.

50
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.720
Your decision?

51
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.040
Yes.

52
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.480
I've decided to leave.

53
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.880
Both you and His Lordship

54
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.760
have strong characters,

55
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.200
and undoubtedly,

56
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.720
there will be problems

57
00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.160
after you get married.

58
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.290
Listen,

59
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.040
you should also be careful

60
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.200
when meeting this kind of man.

61
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.090
You haven't recovered
from the whip injury,

62
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.530
so go up to rest now.

63
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.480
I'm leaving.

64
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.320
Okay.

65
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.370
By the way,

66
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.440
wait a minute.

67
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.920
Bring the Scar Recovering Cream here.

68
00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.880
Go.

69
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:20.730
Take care of yourself

70
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.280
in the Mansion.

71
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.690
I have a small surprise for you.

72
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:29.960
This cream is made by myself,

73
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.730
named Scar Recovering Cream.

74
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.730
Try it.

75
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.280
You can apply it to your face.

76
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.050
It can nourish,

77
00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.520
moisturize and whiten your skin.

78
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.730
I've never seen cream like this.

79
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.080
It's so fragrant.

80
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.610
I'm glad you like it. Take it.

81
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.280
Thank you, Sangyu.

82
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.400
I'm leaving.

83
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:56.250
Your Ladyship,

84
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.010
we depended on His Lordship

85
00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.400
to earn money in the past,

86
00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.960
but he expropriated the money now,

87
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.080
and you gave the Scar
Recovering Cream we only had

88
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.490
to others.

89
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.610
What should we do now?

90
00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.170
I don't need to depend
on him to earn money.

91
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.200
Scar Recovering Cream.

92
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.370
Tanxiang.

93
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.520
Take

94
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.010
this stuff.

95
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.960
Miss Wen.

96
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.490
If you don't want it,

97
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.690
just put it there.

98
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.170
Miss Wen.

99
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.490
Miss Xue,

100
00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.170
I thought of

101
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.250
a good thing

102
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.640
and came to you right away.

103
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.280
What is it?

104
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.280
Well,

105
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.490
I thought of

106
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.440
another way to earn money.

107
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.400
Your Ladyship,

108
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.440
please

109
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.370
stop thinking about using Yuxuan.

110
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.490
You were punished to be whipped,

111
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:48.490
and I don't know what
you will suffer next.

112
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.880
It's said

113
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.440
His Lordship has 108 ways

114
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:52.640
to question criminals.

115
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:53.640
Ning Yuxuan...

116
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.440
He is so bad.

117
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.250
It's impossible for me

118
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.520
to keep using him to earn money.

119
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.840
What he did is a one-time deal,

120
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:03.610
but what I'm going to do

121
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:04.960
is big business.

122
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.170
Your Ladyship,

123
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.170
thank you

124
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.570
for sharing me with

125
00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:10.610
whatever good things you have.

126
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.730
You're welcome.

127
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.320
But what I want now

128
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.440
is to live a peaceful life

129
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.880
in the Mansion.

130
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.810
I really don't want to

131
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.280
cause any trouble.

132
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.760
Haven't you bought
new clothes for a long time?

133
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.400
Banxia.

134
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:32.840
Tell me the truth.

135
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.840
Don't you want

136
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.130
to make money with me?

137
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.170
It's not easy

138
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.250
to make money.

139
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.370
It is.

140
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.610
Banxia.

141
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:43.520
Help me.

142
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:45.840
- Are your injuries...
- Your Ladyship.

143
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.730
... recovered?

144
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.690
Yes.

145
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.170
Thanks to your cream, Your Ladyship.

146
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.640
And I applied the rest

147
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.080
on my face.

148
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.320
Really?

149
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.880
I didn't notice that.

150
00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.130
How is the effect?

151
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.400
Well,

152
00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.640
about the effect...

153
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:04.760
Banxia.

154
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.840
It's true.

155
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:07.490
Your skin indeed looks

156
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.880
more tender.

157
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.010
It's very moisturized.

158
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:12.200
What I'm going to sell

159
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.010
is the Scar Recovering Cream.

160
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:13.760
Listen,

161
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.490
this cream couldn't only

162
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:15.880
smooth all scars

163
00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.810
Banxia had,

164
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.250
but also nourish her skin.

165
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:18.960
A little of it

166
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.250
could smooth your wrinkles.

167
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.170
Does it

168
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.640
really have such an amazing effect?

169
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.440
Isn't Banxia

170
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:26.520
a living example?

171
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.320
You can doubt me,

172
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.080
but you do see

173
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:29.520
its effect with your two eyes,
don't you?

174
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.050
I can't fake it, can I?

175
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:32.690
Right?

176
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.280
Listen,

177
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.960
as long as

178
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.400
we open up an outlet,

179
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:39.490
we can make a big fortune.

180
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:42.730
Your Ladyship,

181
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.170
how about

182
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.440
finding someone more suitable?

183
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.200
Your Ladyship.

184
00:07:57.010 --> 00:07:58.050
To tell you the truth,

185
00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.370
I've made a plan.

186
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:00.690
Once I make enough money,

187
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:01.280
I'll take the money,

188
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.320
leave the Ning's Mansion

189
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:02.960
and Ning Yuxuan

190
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.250
who is a ruthless bad man.

191
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:09.930
However,

192
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.130
I'm indeed

193
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:14.930
in a difficult position now,

194
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.930
and people in the Mansion hate me.

195
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.930
Besides, I haven't recovered
from the whip injury yet.

196
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:21.640
Therefore, I realize
you're the most suitable one

197
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.170
after thinking about it.

198
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:24.520
Me?

199
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.080
(Virtue Prevails)
Add the saffron crocus by 10 maces.

200
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:27.490
Saffron crocus.

201
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:27.730
Move.

202
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.280
No.

203
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.250
It's next to...

204
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:30.570
Yes, that's it.

205
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:31.200
Add another 10 maces of it.

206
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.490
And the flos hibisci.

207
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.800
Flos hibisci.

208
00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.610
10 maces.

209
00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:34.730
Add it now.

210
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.970
You'll miss the right time.

211
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.160
Stir it.

212
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.490
Drop the almond oil.

213
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.610
Drop it now.

214
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.160
Yes.

215
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.400
Fan it.

216
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.880
The fire is too small.

217
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.370
Yes.

218
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:55.040
Yes.

219
00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:57.970
Check the smell.

220
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.730
It's the right smell.

221
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.880
Good.

222
00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:08.090
Your scar disappeared.

223
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:08.730
Yes.

224
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:09.850
Didn't it disappear?

225
00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:10.330
Well...

226
00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.160
Look at my skin.

227
00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.490
It's different, isn't it?

228
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.560
What I use is this.

229
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:17.920
Scar Recovering Cream.

230
00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.330
Let me apply it on you.

231
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.560
Okay. Do it.

232
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.800
Rub it.

233
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.040
And then pat it.

234
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:24.560
Pat it.

235
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.210
It's very moisturized.

236
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.040
Check it.

237
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.400
Let's make a comparison.

238
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:27.970
Look.

239
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.280
It's different, isn't it?

240
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.210
Yes.

241
00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:31.090
- It looks so different.
- I didn't cheat you.

242
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.160
Yes.

243
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.520
Your Ladyship,

244
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.090
your idea is so good.

245
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.330
Everyone in the mansion

246
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.560
uses the Scar Recovering Cream now,

247
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.010
and we've earned

248
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.370
much money.

249
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.490
Good.

250
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:44.250
My injury

251
00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.090
is about to get recovered,

252
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:47.160
and we'll

253
00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:48.330
leave the Ning's Mansion soon.

254
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.130
Good.

255
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.400
Will we

256
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:52.800
really leave the Ning's Mansion?

257
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.610
Of course.

258
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.130
What is said can not be retracted.

259
00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:56.730
I'm going to get divorced,

260
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.250
and I mean it.

261
00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.490
But His Lordship said

262
00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.010
you couldn't leave.

263
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.760
I'm going to divorce him,

264
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:03.560
so why should I obey him?

265
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:05.330
Even if he's Marquis Moyu

266
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.330
who's the No. 1 Handsome Man
of the Capital,

267
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.760
so what?

268
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.280
Since I don't live a good life,

269
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.520
I'm determined to
divorce him peacefully.

270
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.880
Your Ladyship.

271
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:13.970
Your Ladyship,

272
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.280
something happened.

273
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.280
What's wrong?

274
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:17.680
You're so panicked.

275
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:19.370
All roses in Rose Garden

276
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.370
faded in one night.

277
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.450
What?

278
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:26.210
They faded?

279
00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.800
Think about a way now.

280
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.160
Without these roses

281
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:29.680
as materials,

282
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.680
we can't make the Scar Recovering Cream.

283
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.250
Fame portends trouble.

284
00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.160
What should we do, Your Ladyship?

285
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.090
What should we do?

286
00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:44.490
How about

287
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.970
I ask Mr. Wang to investigate it?

288
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.330
I'd like to see who did this.

289
00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.760
It's just an ineffective remedy,

290
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.560
and it can't solve the problem.

291
00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:58.920
Even if he's Marquis Moyu

292
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.970
who's the No. 1 Handsome Man
of the Capital, so what?

293
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.760
Since I don't live a good life,

294
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:04.760
I'm determined to divorce him peacefully.

295
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.210
She said it so arrogantly.

296
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.210
How much money has she earned?

297
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.010
97.2 taels.

298
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.920
Even 100 taels

299
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.640
could only afford her
with two pieces of clothing.

300
00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:22.760
Just ignore her.

301
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:25.010
I'm afraid

302
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.210
Her Ladyship's business
couldn't last long.

303
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.400
Why?

304
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.250
Roses are the main materials
to make the Scar Recovering Cream,

305
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.450
but

306
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.880
they all faded last night.

307
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.250
Then I'd like to see

308
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.010
how she could earn money
and divorce me peacefully.

309
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.520
Miss Wen,

310
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.250
the roses were indeed fragile.

311
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.560
After being watered
by hot water yesterday,

312
00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.730
they faded.

313
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.250
What nonsense are you talking about?

314
00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:57.210
The reason why they faded

315
00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.970
is that no one has lived

316
00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.090
in this garden for a long time,

317
00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.920
and no one takes care of these roses.

318
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.640
You're right.

319
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.210
I'm inarticulate.

320
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.250
However,

321
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.130
Her Ladyship's Scar Recovering Cream

322
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.520
is very effective.

323
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.400
After you gave it to me as a reward,
and I used it,

324
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.680
my face

325
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.680
indeed becomes rosier.

326
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.610
I'm sorry.

327
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:21.250
I'm going to throw it now.

328
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.330
I'll throw it far away from us.

329
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.680
However,

330
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:32.040
without the roses,

331
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:33.970
no noises

332
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.010
will exist in the Mansion.

333
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.450
Miss Xue,

334
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:40.450
how many people in the Mansion

335
00:12:40.610 --> 00:12:41.490
know this thing?

336
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.610
Not so many people have
stepped into Rose Garden

337
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:43.800
since you moved out,

338
00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.210
so only a few people know that.

339
00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:45.730
Okay.

340
00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:46.640
Spread the news.

341
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.330
Spread it everywhere.

342
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:48.280
I want all people in the Mansion

343
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.250
to know

344
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.800
the materials of the
Scar Recovering Cream are gone.

345
00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:53.640
We'd better not do this.

346
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.400
If so,

347
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.560
we can't sell it anymore.

348
00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.560
Yes.

349
00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.400
How about

350
00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.280
I ask Nanny Liu

351
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:00.160
to buy roses

352
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.490
from outside?

353
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.090
No.

354
00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:05.040
And I'll sell

355
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.800
the stock

356
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.680
by double the price.

357
00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:09.280
Your Ladyship,

358
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.850
can it work?

359
00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:11.680
Think about it.

360
00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.400
There are no roses in Rose Garden,

361
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:16.210
which means

362
00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.560
the stock is the last cream we have.

363
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:21.970
Good idea.

364
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:24.160
Here you are.

365
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.680
Thank you.

366
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:26.760
It's yours.

367
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:27.730
Thank you.

368
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.370
Is it sold out?

369
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:32.330
I'm sorry.

370
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:34.210
The Scar Recovering Cream is sold out.

371
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:34.800
It's sold out.

372
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:35.560
Why?

373
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.880
Why is it sold out again?

374
00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:38.730
We've spent much time queuing.

375
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.250
Nanny Liu, I'm really sorry.

376
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.010
The roses in Rose Garden

377
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.040
all faded.

378
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:44.920
And now

379
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.520
the stock we have

380
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.330
is limited.

381
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.490
We need time to pack

382
00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.010
and check its quality,

383
00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.880
so please be patient.

384
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.610
Why is it sold out?

385
00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:58.640
Miss Qian,

386
00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.640
listen.

387
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.130
We've been waiting for a long time.

388
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.090
If the stock

389
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.330
is totally sold out,

390
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.400
what should we do?

391
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.250
We'll have nothing to use in the future.

392
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:05.880
Yes.

393
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.490
She's right.

394
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:08.330
Calm down.

395
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.760
Please calm down, everyone.

396
00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.490
Her Ladyship

397
00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.330
has been looking
for other substitutions,

398
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.130
but

399
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.090
the roses in Rose Garden

400
00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:15.800
have been cultivated carefully

401
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.560
by her for many years,

402
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.450
so we can't find the same

403
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.520
for the time being.

404
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:22.130
What should we do?

405
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.040
Therefore,

406
00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:23.850
cherish

407
00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.370
the Scar Recovering Cream

408
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:27.580
you have now.

409
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:33.450
How is it?

410
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:34.800
I didn't expect

411
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:36.160
we earned double the money

412
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:37.850
after the roses were destroyed.

413
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:40.330
However,

414
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.010
I have to thank

415
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.130
the troublemaker.

416
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.090
You're very smart, Your Ladyship.

417
00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.040
You turned the disadvantage
into the advantage

418
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:50.040
and won women's favors.

419
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:51.450
It's a piece of cake.

420
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:52.330
I'd like to tell you

421
00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.370
another piece of good news.

422
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:54.800
What is it?

423
00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.010
Not only people in the Ning's Mansion

424
00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.090
but also ladies in the capital

425
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.920
ask me about

426
00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:01.370
the Scar Recovering Cream.

427
00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.560
Ladies in the capital?

428
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.850
Yes.

429
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:08.330
Remember

430
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:09.610
that you can only let them try it

431
00:15:09.730 --> 00:15:10.370
but not sell it to them.

432
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.760
Let's tantalize them.

433
00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.970
I'm sure we can sell it to them

434
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:15.760
by a higher price.

435
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:17.850
The Scar Recovering Cream

436
00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:19.160
only sells in our mansion,

437
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.560
so what if those ladies

438
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.400
buy it from servants at a high price?

439
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.090
We can't make money by then.

440
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.400
It's good

441
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.680
if servants could make money.

442
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.250
Besides,

443
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.610
if those ladies want

444
00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:31.760
to buy the cream,

445
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.610
they have to buy it from us.

446
00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:36.610
We don't need to

447
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.250
bother about trifling matters

448
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.280
since we're going to make great invents.

449
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.010
Good.

450
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.370
It's very strange.

451
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:46.680
After the matter of
Kuixing Restaurant ended,

452
00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.330
and Lackey Ning whipped

453
00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.250
his wife,

454
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.730
there is no news from them.

455
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:52.280
Boss,

456
00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:52.970
we were reckless

457
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:54.130
on the matter of Kuixing Restaurant.

458
00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.850
Lackey Ning is very ruthless,

459
00:15:56.010 --> 00:15:57.520
and he even punished his wife.

460
00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.370
Besides, he ruined our plan.

461
00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.040
Speaking of Nie Sangyu
who is a termagant,

462
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.090
she's really cruel.

463
00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.040
She didn't only want
to murder her husband

464
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.560
but also used him to make money.

465
00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.730
Everything is possible

466
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:06.450
in the world.

467
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.880
That was Lackey Ning's fault.

468
00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:09.330
We wanted to assassinate him,

469
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:10.450
but he tried to use us

470
00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.450
to kill his wife.

471
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:13.370
I think we were used by him.

472
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:14.610
We were used by him?

473
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.280
Let's put the matter of
killing Ning Yuxuan aside

474
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:29.130
for the time being,

475
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:31.730
because we have

476
00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:34.130
a more important thing to do.

477
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:37.010
Your Lordship,

478
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.280
Her Ladyship has sold out

479
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.560
the rest Scar Recovering Cream.

480
00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.040
Sold out?

481
00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.850
(Your Lordship,)

482
00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.850
(I come to send you the ginseng soup.)

483
00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:50.880
Why do you come here?

484
00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.250
Haven't I said

485
00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:53.490
I don't need to be served?

486
00:16:54.090 --> 00:16:54.970
My father specially

487
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.490
asked someone to
send this old ginseng to me

488
00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.130
after I was stabbed.

489
00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.330
It's very precious.

490
00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:00.490
You've been working hard

491
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.640
at searching for the assassinators

492
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:03.280
during these days,

493
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:04.210
so I specially

494
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:05.560
braised it and sent it to you.

495
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:09.890
Since it's for you,

496
00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:10.800
and you don't look well,

497
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:11.800
just eat it.

498
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.210
You just got attacked,

499
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.650
so focus on resting.

500
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:18.970
Okay.

501
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:19.690
Leave.

502
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:51.450
Have you used the
Scar Recovering Cream recently?

503
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.280
Buy one for me.

504
00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:05.210
Yes.

505
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.040
What's this?

506
00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:11.450
Your Ladyship.

507
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.360
They are tonics

508
00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:13.650
sent by General Tao.

509
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:16.450
I see.

510
00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.080
Am I

511
00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:22.930
familiar with General Tao?

512
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:23.650
Yes.

513
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.560
He was your classmate.

514
00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:28.360
It seems

515
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.280
not all people

516
00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.410
hate me.

517
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:32.560
If you really divorce His Lordship,

518
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.250
you can marry General...

519
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:35.560
Nonsense.

520
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.280
I won't marry another man

521
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:38.800
after getting divorced.

522
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.520
Isn't it wonderful

523
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.410
to spend the money I earn?

524
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:43.600
Yes.

525
00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:45.280
Your Ladyship.

526
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:46.490
Miss Xue.

527
00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:48.170
Good news.

528
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.120
Sit down.

529
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:50.360
What's wrong?

530
00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:51.890
Didn't we say

531
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.600
to use the Scar Recovering Cream

532
00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:54.250
to tantalize those rich ladies?

533
00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:55.170
Unexpectedly,

534
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.120
Miss Wen was tantalized.

535
00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.210
Miss Wen?

536
00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:00.320
She went to serve tea

537
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.280
to His Lordship,

538
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:02.520
but she looked so sallow

539
00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:03.320
that Yuxuan

540
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.080
drove her out directly.

541
00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.410
When Miss Wen left,

542
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.080
she saw the servants

543
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:09.410
look tender,

544
00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:10.690
and she was so angry

545
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.170
that she ordered someone
to buy the Scar Recovering Cream.

546
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.210
But the cream

547
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.760
is rare in our mansion,

548
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.360
and no one was
willing to sell it to her.

549
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.410
Helplessly,

550
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.250
Miss Wen could only

551
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.210
offer triple the price

552
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:22.010
to buy the cream.

553
00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:23.690
Only then did someone sell it to her.

554
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.450
No.

555
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:27.970
I gave one bottle to her before.

556
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.890
That's really strange.

557
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.320
Didn't she use it?

558
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:35.840
Never mind.

559
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:37.490
Miss Xue,

560
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.800
these are tonics sent by Tao's Mansion.

561
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:39.520
Take them.

562
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:40.930
And you can take

563
00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.120
whatever you like

564
00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:43.010
in my room.

565
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.210
Are you really going to leave?

566
00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:46.970
Yes.

567
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:48.490
I plan

568
00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.650
to open a store

569
00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.450
to continue selling

570
00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:53.930
the Scar Recovering Cream after leaving.

571
00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:58.730
That's really good.

572
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:00.890
I'm so envious of you.

573
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.840
I have a brother

574
00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.410
who is preparing for
imperial examinations,

575
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.560
and I need Yuxuan's help,

576
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:08.280
so I can't leave the Ning's Mansion

577
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.840
tentatively.

578
00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:13.280
Miss Xue,

579
00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:14.760
that's okay.

580
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:15.930
Tell me

581
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:16.490
and come to me

582
00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.360
whenever

583
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:17.930
you need my help

584
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:18.760
in the future.

585
00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:19.690
Remember

586
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.520
that we're the best

587
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:21.360
business partners.

588
00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:27.320
Here is the thing.

589
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.560
The reason why I ask you here

590
00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:29.970
is for nothing

591
00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:31.890
but that I want to give you something.

592
00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.320
I've decided

593
00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:35.520
to leave the Ning's Mansion

594
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:37.410
at 7 pm tomorrow.

595
00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:38.320
Therefore,

596
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:39.450
please

597
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.560
send me off at the front door

598
00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.410
for the sake of our relationship.

599
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.650
Moreover,

600
00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:47.010
you can take whatever you like

601
00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:50.210
in my Reflection Pavilion.

602
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.280
I can't take them, anyway.

603
00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:52.360
Help yourself.

604
00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:53.320
Just take them.

605
00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.080
Well...

606
00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:57.970
I mean it.

607
00:20:58.210 --> 00:20:59.210
You can take them.

608
00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.600
Take whatever you like.

609
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:02.120
Take them all,

610
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.040
such as candelabrums,

611
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.760
chairs, stools,

612
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:06.970
tables,

613
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:07.930
and mirrors.

614
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:08.320
Take them as you like.

615
00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:09.250
Take them as you like.

616
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.280
Help yourself.

617
00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.080
Well...

618
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.840
Don't worry, everyone.

619
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:18.760
Her Ladyship is different

620
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:20.080
from what she used to be,

621
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:20.690
so

622
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.760
just take

623
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:22.600
whatever you like.

624
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:23.010
Yes.

625
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.280
Take whatever you want.

626
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:24.800
Take them all.

627
00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:25.410
Take them all.

628
00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:34.600
I see.

629
00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.410
You're too shy to
take them when I'm here,

630
00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.010
aren't you?

631
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.730
I'll leave.

632
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:38.600
I'll leave.

633
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:47.800
I only want this one.

634
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.800
Well, can we really take them?

635
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:03.450
Let's go.

636
00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:05.890
I want this one.

637
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:06.760
This is also good.

638
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:07.520
I'll take this.

639
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.280
I want this one.

640
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.360
This is mine.

641
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.250
I chose it first.

642
00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.970
♪I'm happy to see your smiling face♪

643
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:19.080
Do you know what it means?

644
00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:22.800
I come to officially inform you

645
00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.520
that I'll leave the Mansion tomorrow.

646
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.210
From then on, we'll live
our own lives separately

647
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.840
and be extremely antagonistic.

648
00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.930
Have you prepared the carriage?

649
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:36.520
Yes.

650
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:38.490
I'll leave at the Mansion's front door

651
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.490
at 7:45 tomorrow night.

652
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.650
How about I send you off by then?

653
00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.360
Will wonders never cease?

654
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.490
You don't have a good intention, do you?

655
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.890
You overthought about it.

656
00:22:59.450 --> 00:23:00.450
After all, you were my wife,

657
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.280
so I should send you off.

658
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.690
Ning Yuxuan, listen.

659
00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:12.760
No matter

660
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:13.730
what plans you have,

661
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.410
I...

662
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.600
I'll leave the Ning's Mansion

663
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.690
no matter what,

664
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:23.360
understood?

665
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:36.970
So annoying.

666
00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:40.490
Muxu, let's go.

667
00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:58.840
Why hasn't Her Ladyship come out yet?

668
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.450
When I was bullied

669
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:01.840
by Her Ladyship,

670
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:03.360
I really wanted her

671
00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:04.890
to leave the Ning's Mansion
as soon as possible,

672
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.450
but I didn't expect

673
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.280
her to leave here so soon

674
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.450
after

675
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.080
I just made friends with her.

676
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.010
I didn't expect it, either.

677
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:15.690
Why does Her Ladyship

678
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.730
become like this now?

679
00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:26.520
Here comes the Second Lady.

680
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:27.210
Miss Wen.

681
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:27.800
Second Lady.

682
00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:29.120
- Second Lady.
- Second Lady.

683
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:29.800
Do you also come

684
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:30.690
to send Her Ladyship off,

685
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.080
Miss Xue?

686
00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.360
Are you also the same?

687
00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:38.650
I'm really reluctant to see her leave,

688
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:40.730
and I want to persuade her to stay here.

689
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.600
After all, she's managed
the Ning's Mansion for many years,

690
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.250
and what should we do

691
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.600
after she leaves?

692
00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.840
You have to

693
00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:49.560
take her responsibility from now on.

694
00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:55.210
We've been waiting for Her Ladyship

695
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.170
for a long time,

696
00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.450
but she hasn't come yet.

697
00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.170
Does anything happen to her?

698
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:02.490
Could she regret it?

699
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:03.970
We've been waiting for a long time.

700
00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:06.890
Her Ladyship always keeps her word,

701
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:08.760
and she won't regret it.

702
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.080
You're right.

703
00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.490
Then why hasn't she come here yet?

704
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.360
Yes, why?

705
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:17.800
Let's wait for her for a while more.

706
00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:19.760
Okay.

707
00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:20.450
Okay.

708
00:25:20.450 --> 00:25:21.320
Maybe

709
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.690
she'll come here soon.

710
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:29.690
Your Ladyship, no one is here.

711
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:33.690
Your Ladyship,

712
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.280
are you sure to
leave through the back door?

713
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.120
Yes.

714
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:37.120
But

715
00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:38.010
why can't we leave the Ning's Mansion

716
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.250
aboveboard?

717
00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.930
We can have an aboveboard attitude,

718
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.360
but our purpose

719
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.840
is to leave the Ning's Mansion successfully.

720
00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:48.410
Go.

721
00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:49.730
Listen,

722
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:51.840
this is called making a feint to
the east and attack in the west.

723
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.280
All people have paid

724
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:54.600
attention to

725
00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.280
the front yard,

726
00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:58.840
so we can

727
00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.450
swagger here,

728
00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.120
right?

729
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.360
Goodbye, Ning Yuxuan.

730
00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.360
Close the door.

731
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.970
Close it.

732
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:25.080
Why are there so many people outside?

733
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:25.890
Your Ladyship.

734
00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:27.080
Let me think of a way.

735
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.010
Think of a way.

736
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:29.450
I'll think of a way.

737
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.650
It's very late now.

738
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.360
Where are you going?

739
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.080
Why are you everywhere?

740
00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:43.800
Do you think

741
00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:44.840
it's easy

742
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:45.600
to leave

743
00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.040
my mansion?

744
00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:51.490
I've told you

745
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.410
many times

746
00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.010
that we don't match each other,

747
00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:55.930
so let's end our relationship, okay?

748
00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:57.360
Then why did you

749
00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:58.280
try to marry me

750
00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.120
with all your effort?

751
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:06.560
I was

752
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:07.970
innocent at that time.

753
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:09.760
And I just found that

754
00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:10.490
when I was with you...

755
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:12.450
You contradicted yourself
and did everything at will.

756
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.080
Servants,

757
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.010
send Your Ladyship back
to Reflection Pavilion.

758
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.600
Wait.

759
00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:18.410
Let me tell you

760
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.760
that I'll never go back no matter what.

761
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:22.210
You just did it out of impulse,

762
00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:23.560
and I won't blame you.

763
00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:25.080
Go back.

764
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.120
Impulse?

765
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.410
I've already made the decision.

766
00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.210
Even if I have to sleep on the street,

767
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.800
I won't go back to the Ning's Mansion.

768
00:27:31.970 --> 00:27:33.250
Sleep on the street.

769
00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.120
You don't consider results

770
00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.120
more and more when doing things.

771
00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:39.040
I can't connive you anymore.

772
00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:43.800
Take her.

773
00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:45.490
- Yes.
- Yes.

774
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:47.800
No.

775
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.320
No.

776
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:49.930
Let me go.

777
00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:50.560
Let's go, Your Ladyship.

778
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:51.360
Let's go, Your Ladyship.

779
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:53.120
Go.

780
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.210
No.

781
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.450
Ning Yuxuan.

782
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.520
Let me go.

783
00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:57.360
Haven't your parents taught you

784
00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.560
what sympathy is?

785
00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:00.320
Shut up.

786
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:01.410
No.

787
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.800
I'm afraid

788
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:03.650
even your parents

789
00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.650
can't get close to you
since you're so indifferent.

790
00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:11.040
That's my business

791
00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.490
and has nothing to do with you.

792
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.210
Go back to Reflection Pavilion.

793
00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:19.800
No.

794
00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:24.690
Are you done?

795
00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.080
Send her back.

796
00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.360
- Yes.
- Yes.

797
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:31.450
Ning Yuxuan.

798
00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:32.250
Please go, Your Ladyship.

799
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.690
It's you that agreed to
divorce peacefully.

800
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:34.360
Go.

801
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:35.040
Ning Yuxaun,

802
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:36.170
it's you that agreed
to divorce peacefully.

803
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:36.760
Your Lordship,

804
00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.210
there are over ten people
in an old temple

805
00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.120
- ten miles outside West City.
- (Let me go.)

806
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.170
I wonder

807
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:41.080
if they are related

808
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.450
to the three people
who escaped last time.

809
00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:45.360
Prepare the horse.

810
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:06.890
Are they

811
00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.690
also bandits?

812
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.210
It seems not.

813
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.210
Perhaps because they are in a big amount

814
00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.280
and gather together,

815
00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:17.320
so officers recognized them wrongly.

816
00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:18.730
Check their arms.

817
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.600
Don't hurt the innocent.

818
00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.170
Yes.

819
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:53.560
Sir.

820
00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:54.520
Sir, please.

821
00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:56.010
Please save my child.

822
00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:56.690
He hasn't eaten food

823
00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.560
for three days.

824
00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:58.520
Please

825
00:29:58.690 --> 00:29:59.560
save us.

826
00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:00.360
Please.

827
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.280
Who are you?

828
00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.800
Why do you gather here?

829
00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:03.800
We are all

830
00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:06.080
poor and homeless people,

831
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.120
and we're really driven desperate.

832
00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:08.690
Sir,

833
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.280
please save us.

834
00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.490
Look at my poor child.

835
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.450
Come on.

836
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:32.280
Your Lordship.

837
00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.040
Gui Bai.

838
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.930
Stop him.

839
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:37.250
Your Lordship.

840
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.930
Don't hurt them,

841
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:42.890
all of you.

842
00:30:52.010 --> 00:30:52.890
Why?

843
00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:54.010
I just wanted

844
00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:55.210
to kill you. You bad official.

845
00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.250
Ning Yuxuan,

846
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:57.730
you were very ruthless

847
00:30:58.170 --> 00:30:59.040
and killed

848
00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:00.360
all our relatives.

849
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.490
You said to kill bandits

850
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:02.490
and bring benefit to people,

851
00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:04.210
but they were all nonsense.

852
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.600
We poor people

853
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.490
only want to make a living,

854
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.320
but you put all children's fathers

855
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:15.760
and women's husbands

856
00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:17.520
into jail.

857
00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:19.450
How should we live then?

858
00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:20.210
Shut up.

859
00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:21.360
You're willing to be bandits

860
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:22.930
and hurt people.

861
00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.600
Do you think you can

862
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.760
call white black with your wrong words?

863
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:25.520
I don't care.

864
00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:26.690
Anyway, our children

865
00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.840
are going to die from
sickness and starvation,

866
00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:30.520
and I don't want to live, either.

867
00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.650
Kill me if you have guts.

868
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:34.970
Kill us!

869
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:35.970
Kill us!

870
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:36.890
Kill us!

871
00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.280
Kill us!

872
00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:39.600
Kill us!

873
00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:40.650
Kill us!

874
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.410
Kill us!

875
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.490
Kill us!

876
00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:45.930
Kill us!

877
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.210
Kill us!

878
00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:56.560
Your Lordship,

879
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:57.930
you're seriously injured

880
00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.410
and need to go back to
the Mansion for remedy.

881
00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:00.490
I'll take you to Dr. Li.

882
00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:01.930
Remain silent about this matter.

883
00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:04.250
The fewer people know it, the better.

884
00:32:04.410 --> 00:32:04.970
Yes.

885
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.120
How do you plan to
deal with them, Your Lordship?

886
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.730
They are just refugees,

887
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.970
so even if they are related to bandits,

888
00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:21.840
they shouldn't be punished seriously.

889
00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.010
But it's a serious crime
to assassinate an official

890
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:24.410
appointed by the imperial court.

891
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:26.120
If Ministry of Justice
and Court of Judicial Review

892
00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:27.970
know that I get injured,

893
00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.280
I'm sure

894
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.520
that woman will die.

895
00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.080
Arrange them for me now.

896
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.120
Settle them down.

897
00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:38.760
No.

898
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:39.930
I'm worried about you.

899
00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.760
I'll take you back to
the Mansion personally.

900
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.600
I'm fine.

901
00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.080
Go.

902
00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:48.600
Yes.

903
00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.410
Find water and food.

904
00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.650
Yes.

905
00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:08.800
(During these years,)

906
00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.930
(I've been aspiring
to catch all bandits)

907
00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.410
(because I don't only want to find)

908
00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:15.730
(the leftover evildoers of
the Tea Gang who killed my father)

909
00:33:16.410 --> 00:33:17.930
(but also to bring peace to the world.)

910
00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:20.410
(However, I often use extreme methods.)

911
00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:22.730
(Am I)

912
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:25.450
(wrong?)

913
00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.100
(Reflection Pavilion)

914
00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:01.650
He's just a ruthless bad man

915
00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:02.690
who goes back on his word.

916
00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.520
What he said

917
00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:05.450
to allow me to leave the Mansion

918
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.410
and get divorced peacefully

919
00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.600
is a lie.

920
00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:08.930
You liar!

921
00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:11.560
I'm so pissed off.

922
00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:17.080
You come to

923
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:18.240
apologize to me, right?

924
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:18.890
I won't accept.

925
00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:19.560
Get out.

926
00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:22.330
Get out?

927
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:24.720
It's you that let me enter here.

928
00:34:24.890 --> 00:34:26.160
Get out, both of you.

929
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:46.560
What's wrong?

930
00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:55.680
Are... Are you injured?

931
00:34:58.290 --> 00:34:59.410
I'll go to find a physician for you.

932
00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.640
No.

933
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:03.520
We can't let anyone know this.

934
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.080
But you're seriously injured.

935
00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:06.120
No.

936
00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:07.330
Okay.

937
00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:08.770
I'll bring the medicine
to stop you from bleeding, okay?

938
00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:09.490
Muxu.

939
00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:10.410
Muxu.

940
00:35:12.010 --> 00:35:12.490
Go.

941
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.640
Go to bring the medical kit here.

942
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:14.890
What's...

943
00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.400
What's wrong with His Lordship?

944
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:16.560
Stop asking. Go.

945
00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:18.720
Keep quiet.

946
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:23.720
Hold on.

947
00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.890
Why are you seriously injured?

948
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.370
How about Gui Bai?

949
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.640
Wasn't he with you?

950
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.080
Sir.

951
00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:37.010
Our man saw Gui Bai

952
00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:38.600
left the city alone late at night.

953
00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.160
Gui Bai?

954
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:40.970
Yes.

955
00:35:41.410 --> 00:35:43.510
(Zheng)
I've ordered someone to follow him.

956
00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:46.120
Keep a close eye on him.

957
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.970
Stop him from doing

958
00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:52.720
whatever he wants to do.

959
00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:54.240
I see.

960
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:04.810
I know you're unwilling

961
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:05.890
to be touched,

962
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.040
but how can I apply medicine on you

963
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:07.850
when I can't see your injury?

964
00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:08.850
Leave me alone.

965
00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:09.850
Get away.

966
00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:13.410
Sorry to be rude.

967
00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:20.370
Your Ladyship.

968
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.240
Here is the medical kit.

969
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:24.560
You've bled so much.

970
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:28.240
I'll stop you from bleeding first.

971
00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.370
No.

972
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.890
It's not enough.

973
00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:38.410
I must prescribe the medicine.

974
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.040
Muxu,

975
00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.200
go to take the paper and brush pen.

976
00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:41.970
I'll prescribe the medicine for you.

977
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:42.520
Go.

978
00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:43.490
Okay.

979
00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.720
Hold on.

980
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:04.720
Your Ladyship.

981
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.080
Your Ladyship.

982
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:07.770
Your Ladyship, here are
the paper and brush pen.

983
00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:12.520
Give me.

984
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:27.980
(Horse's Manure)

985
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:33.890
It's done.

986
00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.640
Go to find the medicine in the pharmacy.

987
00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:36.770
Take them all for me.

988
00:37:36.930 --> 00:37:37.410
Okay.

989
00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:40.120
Horse's manure?

990
00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:41.370
Your Ladyship,

991
00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:42.560
I know the first kinds of medicine,

992
00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:43.200
but should I take

993
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:44.640
the horse's manure in the stable?

994
00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.290
That's

995
00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:46.120
important.

996
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.890
Go and take it.

997
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:47.970
Okay.

998
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:33.930
Give me your hand.

999
00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:34.640
Your Ladyship.

1000
00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.120
Your Ladyship, here is the medicine.

1001
00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:38.850
Okay.

1002
00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.810
That's the smell I want.

1003
00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:45.810
Ning Yuxuan, come on.

1004
00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:46.680
Take the medicine.

1005
00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:49.490
Take it.

1006
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:52.640
What's wrong?

1007
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:55.080
It smells strange.

1008
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:56.850
I know,

1009
00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:58.490
but it works well on stopping bleeding.

1010
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.520
How do you know about prescribing?

1011
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:01.200
I...

1012
00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:04.120
I don't know.

1013
00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:04.720
I only knew

1014
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:05.410
that I thought of this prescription

1015
00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.680
the moment I saw your injury,

1016
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:07.600
and its taste

1017
00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.490
is right.

1018
00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.810
Take it.

1019
00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:10.720
Come on.

1020
00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.410
Get away.

1021
00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:13.410
Be careful.

1022
00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.040
We don't have this medicine anymore.

1023
00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:18.120
Why didn't you know my kindness?

1024
00:39:20.450 --> 00:39:21.720
Don't blame me for being rude.

1025
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:23.120
Take it for me.

1026
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.560
Come on, Muxu. Help me.

1027
00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:30.680
What are you doing?

1028
00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:31.930
Your Ladyship.

1029
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:33.680
What are you doing?

1030
00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.810
Your Ladyship, what knot are you tying?

1031
00:39:36.930 --> 00:39:37.850
Sailor's Knot.

1032
00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:39.600
Sailor's Knot?

1033
00:39:42.370 --> 00:39:43.770
Muxu, give me that rope.

1034
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.810
- God shows mercy to everyone.
- Come on.

1035
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:48.240
I can't see him in danger
without doing anything.

1036
00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.120
I must

1037
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:53.080
let you take

1038
00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:53.770
the medicine today.

1039
00:39:58.810 --> 00:39:59.450
Open your mouth.

1040
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:06.080
Open your mouth.

1041
00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.040
No.

1042
00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:10.080
Open your mouth.

1043
00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:10.640
Your Lordship.

1044
00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.370
You'll die if you refuse taking it.

1045
00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:24.040
You won't take it

1046
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.240
until I treat you seriously, will you?

1047
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:27.560
Fine.

1048
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:30.010
Muxu,

1049
00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:31.850
take my bamboo ruler here.

1050
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:32.770
I must

1051
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:33.930
open his mouth today.

1052
00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:44.370
Sir,

1053
00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:45.680
we got it

1054
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.810
from Gui Bai.

1055
00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:48.160
I've researched on it.

1056
00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:49.290
This prescription

1057
00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:51.120
is specially for stopping bleeding
and diminishing inflammation.

1058
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:51.810
Besides,

1059
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:52.560
some of the medicine

1060
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:53.490
have strong effects,

1061
00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:55.370
and I think the person
who uses the medicine

1062
00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.640
is seriously injured.

1063
00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.490
Someone is injured,

1064
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.080
and Gui Bai gets the medicine.

1065
00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.370
You didn't give yourself away, did you?

1066
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.930
No.

1067
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.490
We only

1068
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.080
stopped Gui Bai,

1069
00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:15.240
killed his horse,

1070
00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.330
and robbed his money

1071
00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:17.600
in the disguise of bandits

1072
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:19.160
according to your order.

1073
00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:20.160
Continue the investigation.

1074
00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:21.410
Check what Ning Yuxuan

1075
00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:22.970
has done recently.

1076
00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.040
Yes.

1077
00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.640
You're awake.

1078
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:55.720
How do you feel?

1079
00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:56.970
Do you feel better?

1080
00:41:57.810 --> 00:41:58.450
Tell me.

1081
00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:00.490
Why am I here?

1082
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:03.720
Do you forget everything?

1083
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:09.720
I spent the whole night

1084
00:42:09.850 --> 00:42:11.410
trying to feed you the medicine,

1085
00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.490
and you actually forget everything.

1086
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:18.640
Okay.

1087
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.810
Let me repeat.

1088
00:42:21.930 --> 00:42:22.680
Listen up.

1089
00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:23.410
You rushed into my room

1090
00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:24.370
last night all of a sudden,

1091
00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:25.010
and I

1092
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.850
recognized you.

1093
00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:27.520
When I asked you questions,

1094
00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.200
you didn't answer.

1095
00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:29.200
You didn't answer.

1096
00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:30.160
Then I turned around.

1097
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:30.890
Surely enough,

1098
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:32.080
you had a big piece of bloodstain.

1099
00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:33.240
I was shocked

1100
00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:33.970
and wondered what happened.

1101
00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:35.120
Then I pulled you on the bed,

1102
00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.120
but you were disobedient.

1103
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:37.810
Look.

1104
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:38.600
You suffered

1105
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.240
since you didn't listen to me.

1106
00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:39.810
Surely enough,

1107
00:42:39.930 --> 00:42:40.560
look how seriously

1108
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:41.810
injured you're.

1109
00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:43.080
Ning Yuxuan,

1110
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:44.890
I didn't expect you
to get into such a plight.

1111
00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.240
I couldn't ignore you
when you were about to die,

1112
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:47.370
so I had to find medicine for you.

1113
00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:49.200
It was time to heal the
wounded and rescue the dying,

1114
00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:50.290
so I asked someone
to find the Horse's Manure.

1115
00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:50.680
I wondered

1116
00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:51.850
if you liked to eat the horse's
manure with the poop smell

1117
00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:53.010
or the poop with
the horse's manure smell.

1118
00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.120
I didn't care what you liked to eat.

1119
00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.010
At that time,

1120
00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.560
you couldn't make the choice yourself.

1121
00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:58.010
When I put the
horse's manure on your mouth,

1122
00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.240
I felt so happy.

1123
00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:01.680
Otherwise, you would have died.

1124
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:02.600
I did it for your good.

1125
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.240
And then,

1126
00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:04.200
I used the bamboo ruler

1127
00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:05.290
to open your mouth.

1128
00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:06.410
Look.

1129
00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:07.370
You finally took the medicine.

1130
00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:08.330
How did you feel?

1131
00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:09.410
You shouldn't have bullied me.

1132
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:11.010
I never dreamed you
could come to such a pass.

1133
00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.330
I'm so happy.

1134
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:13.600
That's all.

1135
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:15.160
Are you done?

1136
00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:17.370
Yes.
