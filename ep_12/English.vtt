=Episode 12=

3
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.410
Never mind if you won't go.

4
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.570
I'll go.

5
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.960
I'll wait for you then.

6
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.050
Prepare yourself.

7
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.010
We'll set off soon.

8
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.420
(We sincerely invite you
and your wife to the party.)

9
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.960
Celebrities.

10
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.800
It's true.

11
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.380
(Magistrate's Residence)

12
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.530
What's taking her so long?

13
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.290
Is she having a hard time
getting dressed again?

14
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.160
I'm coming.

15
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:33.600
Do I look good?

16
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.160
I'm asking you.

17
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.810
Am I pretty?

18
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.920
What took you so long?

19
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.920
Where have you been?

20
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.130
I went to pick flowers.

21
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.090
Pick flowers?

22
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.800
Don't you notice

23
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.690
something different?

24
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.370
Your hair wear

25
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.290
is indeed different

26
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.130
today.

27
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.400
They are real.

28
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.250
Be careful.

29
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.250
Didn't I look like a good wife

30
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.200
when I was walking
towards you just now?

31
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.610
Even more so

32
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.760
if you stop talking.

33
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.570
What do you mean?

34
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.440
I prepared for a long time.

35
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.370
Wait for me.

36
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.930
Here, please.

37
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.370
Mr. Ning, it's the first time
you've come to Haifang.

38
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.880
Our life here is not as extravagant

39
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.130
as the capital city.

40
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.200
I wonder if you

41
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.810
are used to living here.

42
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.280
Haifang is wide in area
and abundant in resources.

43
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.320
Haifang and the capital
are both good in different ways.

44
00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.690
Mr. Wang,

45
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.130
I heard something violent

46
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.370
happened in the Magistrate's Residence.

47
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.320
It really worries

48
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.810
my wife.

49
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:51.440
She can't even sleep at night.

50
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.640
That's true.

51
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.440
The Magistrate's Residence
did undergo some accidents.

52
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.170
The previous magistrates

53
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.440
all died of unnatural causes.

54
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.520
It's such a pity.

55
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.050
Of course,

56
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.010
unlike them,

57
00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.130
you are blessed.

58
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.880
I'm sure you can fend off the evil.

59
00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.440
Mr. Wang, do you know

60
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.840
how the previous magistrates

61
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.080
got killed?

62
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.320
I have no idea since I'm just

63
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.930
an ordinary citizen.

64
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.170
But rumor has it

65
00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.200
that the former magistrate

66
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.050
was accused of corruption.

67
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.440
His family of three

68
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.690
all jumped off the cliff and died.

69
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.080
Some people said

70
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.840
he was forced to commit suicide.

71
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.840
Who forced him?

72
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.570
It's said it was an order
from the higher-ups.

73
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:49.640
This is

74
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.050
all I know.

75
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.520
Unlike other places,

76
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.170
Haifang is located
at the confluence of three riverways.

77
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.730
It's an ideal place
for intercounty trading.

78
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.730
Many high-rank officials

79
00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.840
are eyeing this place.

80
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.730
The interest relations

81
00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.880
aren't something

82
00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.050
that I can find out.

83
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.880
Do you think I believe it?

84
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.930
Here, Mr. Ning,

85
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.280
let me toast you.

86
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.610
Mr. Wang, I heard

87
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.930
you've done business
in Haifang for years,

88
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:46.880
and you are
the richest businessman here.

89
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.320
So, why is your birthday party today

90
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.050
a little low-key?

91
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.320
Although I've done business for years,

92
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.320
I used most of my money

93
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.640
to help those

94
00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.200
in need.

95
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.320
It's for the peace of our nation.

96
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:04.440
Well,

97
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:06.400
were the previous magistrates

98
00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.960
also your

99
00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.440
frequent visitors once

100
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.840
like me?

101
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.610
Mr. Ning,

102
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.760
this is…

103
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:23.960
She's my wife.

104
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.520
Sorry, I had no idea.

105
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.930
This is my wife,

106
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.010
Hongzhu.

107
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.960
Who's Hongzhu?

108
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.280
Who's Hongzhu?

109
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.610
Mr. Ning,

110
00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.200
here, let's drink.

111
00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.050
Look,

112
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.280
Lady Hongzhu's skin

113
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.930
is so fine and soft.

114
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:51.640
Tell me about it.

115
00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.320
And her necklace is so special.

116
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.610
I want one, too.

117
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:56.570
I bought it

118
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.490
from Chen's Jewelry Store
in the West Market.

119
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:00.840
It's so pretty.

120
00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.010
It's just

121
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.810
some ordinary red agate.

122
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:06.320
Don't you feel embarrassed to wear it?

123
00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.080
Agate isn't

124
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:10.490
that special anyway.

125
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.150
Only south red agate

126
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.710
and Gobi agate

127
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.850
are worth some money.

128
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.930
And this is…

129
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.440
This is my daughter Yueli.

130
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.050
So, it's Miss Wang.

131
00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.690
Nice to meet you.

132
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:29.840
I wish your father

133
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.570
a happy birthday and a long life.

134
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:33.210
But,

135
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.610
it's your father's birthday today.

136
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.370
How come

137
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.610
you don't serve

138
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.850
any dish with meat?

139
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.880
Mr. Ning

140
00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.090
has just arrived in Haifang,

141
00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.400
and he's already seized Jiumu Casino.

142
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.680
It's for the good of the people.

143
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.160
And we are all happy about it.

144
00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:57.970
I'm one

145
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.800
who abhors those engaging

146
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:01.680
in disgusting indulgence.

147
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.610
Today

148
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.250
I'm holding this feast

149
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.010
to thank Mr. Ning

150
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.210
for mopping up

151
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:09.130
such a dirty business.

152
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:09.880
Here,

153
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.130
let's toast Mr. Ning.

154
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.850
Come on.

155
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.370
Cheers.

156
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.680
To Mr. Ning.

157
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.370
To Mr. Ning.

158
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.560
Sit down, please.

159
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.330
Sit down.

160
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.160
Please.

161
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:28.370
Sit down.

162
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:30.880
After hearing

163
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.610
what you said, Mr. Wang,

164
00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.610
I've been thinking a lot.

165
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:35.880
Mr. Wang

166
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.850
is the richest man in Haifang.

167
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.160
The richest man.

168
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.160
Yet he uses all his money

169
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.160
to help those in need.

170
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.010
How kind-hearted he is.

171
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:48.130
And he himself leads such a frugal life.

172
00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.210
Look around.

173
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.730
Mr. Wang, seriously,

174
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.400
I'd like

175
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:55.850
to toast you.

176
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.370
Please accept my respect.

177
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.010
My wife Hongzhu

178
00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.280
once risked her own life to save me
in front of His Majesty,

179
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.090
so the title of Second-rank Lady
with Imperial Mandate

180
00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:10.010
was conferred on her.

181
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.920
Your Ladyship, you are such a heroine.

182
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:17.610
I'm flattered.

183
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.450
You and Mr. Ning

184
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.130
are indeed a match made in heaven.

185
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:22.730
Here, cheers.

186
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:23.800
Cheers.

187
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:31.920
Yueli,

188
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.850
why don't you toast Mr. Ning

189
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.880
and Lady Hongzhu?

190
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.370
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ning,

191
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.040
Lady Hongzhu.

192
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.250
What are you looking at?

193
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.040
Miss Wang,

194
00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:05.970
I have a treasure

195
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.330
that's perfect for you.

196
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.760
What treasure?

197
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:10.730
Muxu,

198
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.760
hurry and give it to Miss Wang.

199
00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.490
Take a look.

200
00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.040
Yueli,

201
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.090
don't decline

202
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.520
Lady Hongzhu's good intention.

203
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:22.680
Open it and take a look.

204
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:23.610
That's right.

205
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.160
There's no harm to take a look.

206
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.850
This is Feiwan Face Cream
specially made by myself.

207
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:38.970
It works very well

208
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160
on the problem you have

209
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:41.680
with your face.

210
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.520
How dare you!

211
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:50.880
Miss Wang.

212
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.370
Miss Wang.

213
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.400
Your Ladyship.

214
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.280
My daughter is spoiled and ill-mannered.

215
00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.560
Don't mind her.

216
00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.520
Please sit down.

217
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.160
Mr. Wang,

218
00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.370
actually,

219
00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.560
I prepared another gift for you.

220
00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:05.610
Hongzhu.

221
00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:21.040
Don't you want to make friends

222
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.640
with those celebrities?

223
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.370
Muxu.

224
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.160
Mr. Wang.

225
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.370
Mr. Ning,

226
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.490
what's this about?

227
00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:51.160
This is no ordinary dirt.

228
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.090
Ever since I became an official,

229
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.730
I've traveled
to many places for business.

230
00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.490
Every time when I left a place,

231
00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.370
someone would try to give me money,

232
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.040
but I never received once.

233
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.680
And when that happened,

234
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:05.760
I'd ask my people

235
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:07.250
to fetch a handful of local dirt

236
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:08.730
as a warning.

237
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.370
This time I came to Haifang,

238
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:14.010
I brought the dirt
I collected from different places

239
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:14.850
along with me.

240
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.250
And I want to give it to you.

241
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.010
I hope when I

242
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.450
leave here,

243
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.130
you can help me fetch

244
00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.250
a handful of Haifang dirt to see me off.

245
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.280
Mr. Ning,

246
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:35.040
you are such an honest
and incorruptible official.

247
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.760
This box of dirt

248
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.130
is quite meaningful.

249
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:43.010
Don't worry.

250
00:13:43.210 --> 00:13:45.760
I'll keep this box of dirt

251
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.040
very well.

252
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.130
Why did you gift him a box of dirt?

253
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.370
I learned it from you.

254
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.370
When did I ever give people dirt?

255
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.250
The things I give are quite valuable.

256
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.880
Mr. Wang…

257
00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.400
I…

258
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:01.640
Ladies and gentlemen.

259
00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.040
My wife

260
00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.210
is good at creating cosmetic formulas.

261
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.800
Now that she's in Haifang,

262
00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.800
she wants to open a shop

263
00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.130
and run a business herself.

264
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.640
If one day

265
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.490
she really opens a shop in Haifang,

266
00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.160
hope you can visit her shop.

267
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.520
I assure you that it'll be worth it.

268
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.730
I'd like to thank you

269
00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.090
in advance.

270
00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:23.640
Of course.

271
00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.010
Okay.

272
00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:25.680
We will.

273
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.250
All the guests here today

274
00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.760
will get a big discount

275
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:29.970
when visiting my shop.

276
00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.250
Mr. Wang, please do visit my shop.

277
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.040
Mr. Ning, don't worry.

278
00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:41.330
I will go

279
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:42.640
and support

280
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.090
your wife's business.

281
00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:45.520
Then I'll thank you

282
00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:46.640
in advance.

283
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:47.640
It's getting late.

284
00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:49.520
We'll take our leave.

285
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:00.970
Get out, all of you!

286
00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:02.880
Hurry, let's go.

287
00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:03.970
Let's go.

288
00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:18.970
This Mr. Wang

289
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.850
is so ridiculous.

290
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.330
He prepared a tableful
of vegetables for his birthday party.

291
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:23.970
This Mr. Wang

292
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.490
is quite crafty indeed.

293
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.490
You must've noticed the ring mark

294
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:31.280
on Wang Yueli's finger.

295
00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.090
Although in coarse clothes,

296
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:33.970
she

297
00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:34.970
knows very well

298
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:36.210
about jewelry.

299
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:38.640
Moreover,

300
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.370
she was wearing

301
00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:40.610
a gold bracelet inlaid with jade.

302
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.090
Even though they served

303
00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:43.880
a tableful of vegetables,

304
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:44.640
the dishes

305
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.400
were cooked with a wok for meat.

306
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:47.850
I'm sure it wasn't

307
00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:48.800
the first time

308
00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:49.800
they've put on a show like this.

309
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:51.090
It wasn't the first time for sure.

310
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.330
In Haifang, there are two forces,

311
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.730
one on the surface,

312
00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:56.610
and one in the dark.

313
00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.280
The one on the surface

314
00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.640
should be the Dragon Gang,

315
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.730
controlling all kinds of businesses

316
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:01.760
in the nine districts.

317
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.160
And the one in the dark

318
00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:05.330
should be this Wang Jinyao,

319
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.280
the so-called No.1 Philanthropist

320
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.610
in Haifang.

321
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.130
What's wrong?

322
00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:16.560
If you know it, why did you

323
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.400
tell them

324
00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.800
that I'm going to open a cosmetic shop?

325
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:20.250
How am I supposed to do business

326
00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.330
if they cause me trouble?

327
00:16:21.450 --> 00:16:22.730
Haifang has formed

328
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:23.730
a set of rules itself

329
00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:25.040
over the years.

330
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.680
Letting you out

331
00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:27.970
is like…

332
00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.130
Like…

333
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:32.970
Like what?

334
00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:35.280
Like putting a catfish

335
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:36.450
in the river.

336
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.160
I want to stir the water up

337
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.730
and see

338
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:41.850
what they'll do next.

339
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.160
Stir up the water and catch the fish.

340
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.210
That's a good idea.

341
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:51.850
Letting me out…

342
00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.210
Letting me out?

343
00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.130
Are you saying I'm a dog?

344
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:24.320
Dad.

345
00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:26.840
Dad.

346
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.450
Dad.

347
00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.520
What's the matter?

348
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:33.560
You know it.

349
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:35.560
That magistrate's stupid wife

350
00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.650
said I had a problem with my face,

351
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.410
and she gave me this crappy thing.

352
00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.490
I don't want it.

353
00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:42.800
Yueli,

354
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:45.320
you don't have

355
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:46.600
to use this face cream,

356
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.040
but you can't throw it away.

357
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:49.800
It could be useful

358
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:51.650
when you meet her again.

359
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:54.360
Dad.

360
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:55.690
Yueli.

361
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:06.930
Yueli.

362
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.760
Listen to me.

363
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.210
Why do you think

364
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.450
she promoted this face cream

365
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.560
in public today?

366
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.930
Where there's a will,

367
00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.840
there's a way.

368
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:21.730
Yueli,

369
00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.450
this is a matter

370
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.560
of life and death to me.

371
00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:28.490
Don't be willful.

372
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:32.690
You should

373
00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.970
hang out with Mr. Ning's wife

374
00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.930
more often in the future.

375
00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:37.600
Dad.

376
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:38.520
Understood?

377
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.490
Yes, Dad.

378
00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.540
(Magistrate's Residence)

379
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.040
As we thought, Wang Jinyao

380
00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.450
sent a messenger to the capital.

381
00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.560
But he disappeared
as soon as he entered the town,

382
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:14.210
and our men lost him.

383
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:20.410
If they were that easy

384
00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.650
to follow,

385
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.320
it'd be suspicious, actually.

386
00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:26.970
We've got to be careful.

387
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:27.520
Yes.

388
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.690
I'm still investigating the assassins

389
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.760
appeared in the abandoned temple.

390
00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:32.320
Those people are
highly skilled in martial arts.

391
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:33.730
Even in a place full

392
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.280
of talented people like Haifang,

393
00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:36.280
they are still outstanding.

394
00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:37.800
I think they are

395
00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.010
losing their patience

396
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:40.840
after lurking for so long.

397
00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.010
Make sure to investigate secretly.

398
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.280
Do not spook them.

399
00:19:47.410 --> 00:19:47.800
Yes.

400
00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.210
What are these?

401
00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.210
After the birthday party at the Wang's,

402
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.120
many ladies sent invitations

403
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:57.120
to invite Her Ladyship over for tea.

404
00:19:59.170 --> 00:19:59.730
I see.

405
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:01.490
I'm back.

406
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:04.800
Come on, let's eat.

407
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.730
I'm exhausted.

408
00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.170
So many invitations.

409
00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:11.520
For you?

410
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:12.280
Yes.

411
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:17.450
No, for you.

412
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:19.840
For me?

413
00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.320
How is it going with your shop?

414
00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.360
Very well.

415
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.210
With Mr. Yuan's help,

416
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.490
I think my shop can open

417
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.120
in three days.

418
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.170
Mr. Yuan?

419
00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:33.930
You mean Yuan Lang?

420
00:20:35.170 --> 00:20:35.560
Yes.

421
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.010
Why does he help you?

422
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.120
We are business partners.

423
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:44.650
You accepted his money?

424
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.560
Yes.

425
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:51.250
He has money, and I have skills.

426
00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:52.800
We are equal.

427
00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:54.690
I can't let you do it.

428
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.250
Why not?

429
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:57.970
Because I…

430
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:02.760
Because what?

431
00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:05.040
Because I haven't told you the story

432
00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.250
about the expensive tea in Dongshan.

433
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:09.760
What? What tea in where?

434
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:12.170
There was a magistrate in Dongshan,

435
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.320
and he was known for his thrift.

436
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:15.730
The officials who wanted

437
00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.930
to give him a gift couldn't find out

438
00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:17.890
what he liked no matter
how hard they tried,

439
00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.040
until someone mentioned

440
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.490
that he liked a certain type of tea.

441
00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.730
So, the officials did
everything they could

442
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:22.560
to find the tea.

443
00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:23.450
And guess what?

444
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:24.490
What?

445
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.080
One bottle of the tea

446
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:28.560
cost 100 taels of silver.

447
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:30.450
Because the tea shop

448
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.970
was owned by the magistrate's wife.

449
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:39.450
So?

450
00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:51.520
You don't get it?

451
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:53.120
Get what?

452
00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.800
I mean if Yuan Lang

453
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.120
and you open

454
00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.010
a shop together,

455
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.010
it's like opening an opportunity.

456
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.650
You may not use it to make profits,

457
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:07.280
but you can't stop Yuan Lang

458
00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:08.120
from making profits

459
00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:09.210
in your name.

460
00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:11.250
At that time,
if the imperial court finds out,

461
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:12.930
they'll seize your shop

462
00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:15.890
and arrest you.

463
00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.080
Get it now?

464
00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.690
They'll seize my shop?

465
00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:22.890
Then what am I gonna do?

466
00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.520
You'll be fine if you use
your own money.

467
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:37.560
That's right.

468
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:38.520
How much do you need?

469
00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:40.360
I'll give it to you.

470
00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.930
I… I need…

471
00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:44.520
Are you trying to scare me?

472
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:45.730
Is it that serious?

473
00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:46.410
I'm not giving you

474
00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.010
the money for free.

475
00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.080
I need you to do me a favor.

476
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.120
I knew

477
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.930
there was a catch.

478
00:22:57.970 --> 00:22:58.600
Tell me.

479
00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.280
I want you

480
00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:01.800
to take the invitations

481
00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.360
and visit these families

482
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:07.760
one by one in the name

483
00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:09.210
of selling your products.

484
00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.560
And then, help me

485
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.560
find out the detailed information

486
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.320
about the officials

487
00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:16.210
and businessmen in Haifang,

488
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.730
see who's worthy of being hired

489
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:19.690
and who's not.

490
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.600
So, you want me

491
00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.970
to be your eyes and ears.

492
00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:30.730
Then

493
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:32.970
what do you say?

494
00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:40.300
(From Madam Nie.
Hope this letter finds you well.)

495
00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:43.940
(Yours faithfully, Huang Ruoyun)

496
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.360
Who is this?

497
00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.840
The daughter of the Assistant Magistrate.

498
00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.560
She doesn't get along with Wang Yueli.

499
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:50.410
They fight a lot over jewelry

500
00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.360
and clothes.

501
00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:52.210
I want you

502
00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:53.520
to start from

503
00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:55.520
this Lord Huang's family.

504
00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:56.490
How does that sound?

505
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:02.970
No way.

506
00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:15.450
Her skin is so nice.

507
00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:16.730
It is.

508
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.320
So fine.

509
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.600
And so soft.

510
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.650
What's her secret?

511
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.650
I envy her.

512
00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.560
It's full.

513
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:27.890
Have some tea.

514
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:28.690
Thank you.

515
00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:29.360
She looks so elegant.

516
00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.170
Tell me about it.

517
00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:41.170
Good tea.

518
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.600
Your Ladyship, it's such an honor

519
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.800
to have you here joining

520
00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.360
my flowers appreciation gathering.

521
00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:48.410
You are flattering me.

522
00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:49.010
I should thank you

523
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.840
for your invitation, Miss Huang.

524
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.650
Judging by your good manners,

525
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.450
you must be from
a distinguished family in the capital.

526
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:56.410
We aren't as elegant as you are.

527
00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.080
Hope you won't mind.

528
00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:00.210
What are you talking about?

529
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.010
As far as I can see,

530
00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.730
you are all natural beauties,

531
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:05.250
and even outshine those aristocratic girls

532
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:05.970
in the capital.

533
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:06.600
Really?

534
00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.010
No need to be modest.

535
00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.010
Your Ladyship, you are flattering us.

536
00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:11.930
We'd think it's true.

537
00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.040
It is true.

538
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:15.250
Your Ladyship, this is your first time here.

539
00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:16.520
How do you enjoy your stay?

540
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.840
My cousin visited us last year

541
00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:19.410
from the capital.

542
00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:20.210
Only after a few days,

543
00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.080
he started to suffer
from diarrhea and vomiting.

544
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:24.360
That serious?

545
00:25:24.490 --> 00:25:25.490
Yes.

546
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.170
How are you doing?

547
00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:29.890
I…

548
00:25:30.410 --> 00:25:32.210
I don't have a big reaction like that.

549
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.890
But since the climate is different,

550
00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.490
when I first got here,

551
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.840
my face was dry and itchy.

552
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.280
My skin was even
peeling off and swollen.

553
00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:40.450
Really?

554
00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:42.280
This place is by the sea
and rainy all year long.

555
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.690
Your skin was irritated because

556
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.080
of the humidity.

557
00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.560
That's right.

558
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.250
I think so.

559
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.360
Then, Your Ladyship,

560
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:50.650
how did you recover?

561
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.560
Yeah, how?

562
00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.410
- How did you recover?
- Your Ladyship,

563
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.560
please tell us.

564
00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.650
To be honest,

565
00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.490
I've been fond of reading

566
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.250
medical books since I was little,

567
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:01.410
and I'm interested

568
00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.840
in the formulas

569
00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:04.250
for skin care.

570
00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:05.760
Back home, I often

571
00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:07.650
make face cream myself.

572
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.280
And it works very well.

573
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:10.760
No wonder.

574
00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:11.650
By the way…

575
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.600
What's this?

576
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.730
It's my first visit.

577
00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:22.490
I see

578
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.210
that you are living a wealthy life,

579
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.010
so I wasn't sure what to bring you.

580
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:28.410
This is Feiwan Face Cream

581
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.490
I made.

582
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:34.010
It's very good.

583
00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:35.760
You guys can give it a try.

584
00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:37.080
Smells so good.

585
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:38.120
Smells so good.

586
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.170
I also want to try.

587
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.010
So,

588
00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.560
do you like the smell?

589
00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.040
Wow.

590
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:47.120
Smells so good.

591
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.080
I also want to try.

592
00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:48.930
I wanna try, too.

593
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.520
So do I.

594
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.410
Let me try it.

595
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:53.040
Let me.

596
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:53.800
You…

597
00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:58.520
Your Ladyship,

598
00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:00.490
no matter how much
cream you've made

599
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.120
and how much the materials cost,

600
00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.520
I want it all.

601
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.320
As long as

602
00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:05.560
you don't sell it to other people.

603
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.080
Wang Yueli,

604
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.840
what are you doing here?

605
00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:10.010
Huang Ruoyun,

606
00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.560
I do whatever I want to do.

607
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.690
It's none of your business.

608
00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:13.040
Go back home

609
00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:14.210
if you want to act like crazy.

610
00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.650
Don't come here
to annoy my important guest.

611
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:17.280
Important guest?

612
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:19.410
Where are you going?

613
00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:21.760
Come with me.

614
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:23.690
- Your Ladyship.
- Let go.

615
00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.320
Wang Yueli's face looks different today.

616
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:26.730
She's not wearing a veil.

617
00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:27.320
Her face

618
00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.800
has become much smoother.

619
00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:30.930
It's true.

620
00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.210
Your face…

621
00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.760
Oh, yeah.

622
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:34.970
Miss Wang,

623
00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.040
your pimples

624
00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.170
are almost gone.

625
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.890
You used Feiwan Face Cream,
didn't you?

626
00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:40.360
You…

627
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.040
Huang Ruoyun.

628
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.320
So, Her Ladyship's Feiwan Face Cream

629
00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:44.800
is really effective.

630
00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:46.690
It even cured Miss Wang's pimples

631
00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:47.800
that bothered her for years.

632
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.320
You…

633
00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:49.800
That's right.

634
00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.040
Your Ladyship,

635
00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.120
how much do you have?

636
00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.520
We want it all.

637
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:55.250
- I want it, too.
- So do I.

638
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.280
There's enough for everybody.

639
00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:57.650
No matter how much you want.

640
00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:58.210
Don't worry.

641
00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.280
Huang Ruoyun!

642
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.450
How dare you fight me over it?

643
00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.890
I did, so what?

644
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.690
You… Give it to me.

645
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.650
What?

646
00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.170
My wife is drunk

647
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.320
and she twisted her ankle?

648
00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:08.930
Yes.

649
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.010
It's said Miss Huang and Miss Wang

650
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.170
had a fight over

651
00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.080
Feiwan Face Cream,

652
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:14.210
and they hurt Her Ladyship by accident.

653
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.560
Then why did she drink?

654
00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:17.520
She didn't get to sell the face cream,

655
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:18.600
so she drank down her sorrow.

656
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:20.450
She agreed

657
00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.490
to help me find out information.

658
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.120
Why did she sell her products instead?

659
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.890
- Drink and sing.
- Your Ladyship, watch your steps.

660
00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.010
Careful.

661
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:32.010
Life is tough…

662
00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.280
Why did you drink so much?

663
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:35.250
Your Lordship.

664
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:36.410
Let me.

665
00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:40.450
Ning Yuxuan.

666
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:45.120
It's really you.

667
00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:47.170
So what if you didn't
sell the face cream?

668
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.320
You shouldn't have drunk this much.

669
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:50.840
Who said I couldn't sell it?

670
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:54.730
I can sell it.

671
00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.010
I can sell it.

672
00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:59.320
I can sell my treasure.

673
00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:00.210
My treasure…

674
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.970
Keep it well for me.

675
00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:04.410
You…

676
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.730
Keep it well.

677
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.250
Help me keep it well.

678
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.490
What about the mission I gave you?

679
00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:16.010
What mission?

680
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:19.080
Sell the face cream, right?

681
00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:21.170
I really overestimated you.

682
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.280
I can't believe you.

683
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.560
Sell the face cream, right?

684
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.120
Forget it.

685
00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.760
I'll confront you tomorrow.

686
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.760
Feiwan Face Cream…

687
00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:35.320
What?

688
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:37.120
You still haven't found

689
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.080
Ji Ming's whereabouts?

690
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.170
Sorry, I'm not capable enough.

691
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.280
Ji Ming

692
00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:41.250
has never returned

693
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.520
to Luan County

694
00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.360
since he left there 18 years ago.

695
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:45.560
I've sent people

696
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:47.210
to ask about his whereabouts,

697
00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:48.890
but it was really hard

698
00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.320
to find him with only a name.

699
00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.170
I've never heard

700
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.970
from him again

701
00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.410
since he left the hometown 18 years ago.

702
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.080
Where

703
00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.360
is he right now?

704
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.010
We've been looking for a whole day,

705
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:08.560
yet there's still no sign of her.

706
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.690
My Lord, it's so strange.

707
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:11.360
Well,

708
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:12.890
you've got quite
a few friends in the capital.

709
00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:13.890
How come none of them

710
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.490
can find out where Her Ladyship is?

711
00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:16.410
The capital city is huge.

712
00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.560
It's extremely hard

713
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:19.080
to look for someone here.

714
00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.900
(Ning's Mansion)

715
00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.520
How did we get here?

716
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.250
My Lord, you know this place?

717
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:26.360
No.

718
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:27.650
How could I know

719
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:29.250
a high-ranking official like that?

720
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.560
All done.

721
00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:47.610
(Lianxue,)

722
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:48.420
(I'm going to run)

723
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:49.530
(a shop in Haifang,)

724
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:50.840
(and it's opening soon.)

725
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.970
(I need a good accountant)

726
00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:53.730
(like you.)

727
00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.450
(Also, there are all kinds
of people in Haifang.)

728
00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.410
(I'm sure you'll love this place.)

729
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:05.020
(To Qian Lianxue)

730
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.100
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

731
00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:09.520
Haoxue Cosmetics Shop

732
00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:10.650
is opening now.

733
00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.010
Ms. Nie,

734
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:13.800
may your shop prosper
in the years to come,

735
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:15.690
and may it get you lots of fortune.

736
00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:16.970
Wishing you prosperity

737
00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:17.970
and all the best.

738
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:18.970
Thank you for your best wishes.

739
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:19.890
Let's go in and check it out.

740
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:20.280
Okay.

741
00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.760
Check it out.

742
00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:22.690
Look.

743
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.650
This is my Haoxue Cosmetics.

744
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:30.080
How do you like it?

745
00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.450
You decorated

746
00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:33.520
it yourself?

747
00:31:33.690 --> 00:31:34.410
Of course.

748
00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:35.840
And it was done pretty fast.

749
00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:36.690
I hired a part-time carpenter

750
00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.120
to make the cabinet,

751
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.560
and it only cost me 300 pence.

752
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:40.210
I used the rest of the money

753
00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:40.800
to buy a writing-set

754
00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:41.730
for the front desk.

755
00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:42.120
By the way,

756
00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.320
I put the offcut

757
00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:44.120
in the backyard

758
00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.080
for firewood.

759
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:46.450
I made the best use

760
00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.490
of everything, didn't I?

761
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:48.650
You

762
00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:49.280
are indeed good

763
00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:50.280
at running a business.

764
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:51.320
You bet.

765
00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.010
I've never thought

766
00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.360
that the dream I didn't get to fulfill
in the capital

767
00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.760
actually came true in Haifang.

768
00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.800
I should thank you

769
00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:01.650
for funding me.

770
00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:02.890
Appreciate it.

771
00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:03.650
No need to thank me.

772
00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.410
You earned it

773
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.560
yourself.

774
00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:09.520
Instead, I should thank you.

775
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:11.210
For what?

776
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.170
I'm lucky

777
00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:13.490
to be the first customer

778
00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:14.560
of your Haoxue Cosmetics Shop.

779
00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.080
Oh, right.

780
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.930
Wait here.

781
00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:27.320
Put your hand out.

782
00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.410
What now?

783
00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:31.120
Hurry.

784
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:35.650
Congratulations on becoming

785
00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.560
the first customer of my shop.

786
00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.120
What does that mean?

787
00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:47.280
You came to my shop

788
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:48.730
without any money?

789
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:49.760
I don't have money.

790
00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.450
You don't have any money?

791
00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:52.690
Are you gonna dash without paying?

792
00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:53.280
I have no money.

793
00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:53.970
Hurry up and pay.

794
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.080
My shop is open!

795
00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.320
My shop is finally open!

796
00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:27.890
There's more?

797
00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.320
Please enjoy.

798
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:33.690
You are so generous.

799
00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:34.800
Why did you order so much?

800
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:35.600
Haoxue Cosmetics

801
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.320
is open today.

802
00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.650
It's a celebration dinner.

803
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.410
Are these dishes enough?

804
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:42.970
If not,

805
00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:43.760
I'll order more.

806
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.280
It's more than enough.

807
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:45.800
And they are all my favorite dishes.

808
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.930
This is good.

809
00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:53.120
Yum.

810
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.650
Try the bean curd. Very nice.

811
00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:58.280
Isn't that pig brain?

812
00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:01.560
Brain…

813
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:02.690
Pig brain.

814
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:06.170
Don't spit.

815
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:07.840
How could you spit it out

816
00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:09.080
right in the restaurant?

817
00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:10.810
Don't waste it.

818
00:34:17.370 --> 00:34:19.040
Here, honey.

819
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:20.410
Thank you

820
00:34:20.490 --> 00:34:21.520
for the dinner.

821
00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.520
Now, wish me all the best
for tomorrow's opening.

822
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.200
All the best.

823
00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:32.560
Ms. Nie.

824
00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.370
Mr. Yuan.

825
00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:36.810
You are also here.

826
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:38.410
What a small world.

827
00:34:38.890 --> 00:34:40.120
Come on, sit down and join us.

828
00:34:40.330 --> 00:34:41.490
Waiter, bring us a bowl
and a pair of chopsticks.

829
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:42.640
You got it.

830
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.770
This is Mr. Yuan

831
00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:45.560
I told you about.

832
00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.410
Sir, here you go.

833
00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:56.120
Good to see you here.

834
00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:58.890
So, you are Yuan Lang.

835
00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:03.290
I've heard so much about you.

836
00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:04.520
Nice to meet you, Your Lordship.

837
00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.640
We've never met before,

838
00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:07.680
however,

839
00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.890
you look so familiar.

840
00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:12.560
Especially your eyes.

841
00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.490
Have I seen you somewhere?

842
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:26.970
I'm just a traveling businessman.

843
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:29.560
How could I have the honor
to see you before, Marquis Moyu?

844
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:38.720
Ms. Nie,

845
00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:40.640
these dishes

846
00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:42.200
are all my favorites.

847
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.160
Great minds think alike indeed.

848
00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:46.640
He ordered these.

849
00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:47.490
If you like the food,

850
00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:48.600
have some more.

851
00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:53.810
If you enjoy nice food,

852
00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:54.330
I can take you

853
00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:55.720
to other restaurants in the future.

854
00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:56.410
Dear,

855
00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.680
the dishes cooked
in the restaurants may taste good,

856
00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.200
but they aren't as clean
as homemade dishes.

857
00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:09.490
That's true.

858
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:13.810
A free girl

859
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:14.770
shouldn't be kept

860
00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:16.600
in a cold mansion all the time

861
00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:17.330
and be controlled

862
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:18.890
by rules and regulations.

863
00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.290
Right?

864
00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:23.520
It is

865
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:24.600
a little quiet in the Mansion sometimes,

866
00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.120
but I don't have to do anything.

867
00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:27.040
The steward takes care of everything.

868
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.240
I enjoy living there.

869
00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.240
Good to know.

870
00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.040
Sir, your shrimps.

871
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:38.240
Enjoy.

872
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:38.680
Ms. Nie,

873
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.410
I ordered

874
00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:41.560
the shrimps for you.

875
00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:43.410
Here, have some.

876
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:44.930
Seafood is high in iodine.

877
00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:45.930
It's not good for you.

878
00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.640
Ning Yuxuan, don't eat it.

879
00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:49.160
Your injury hasn't healed yet.

880
00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:50.810
Seafood is stimulating.

881
00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.680
So, you can't eat it.

882
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.770
It looks good.

883
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:00.040
Your Lordship,

884
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:02.640
everybody has the right

885
00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:05.080
to pursue what they like.

886
00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:07.120
Don't you think?

887
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:12.160
It tastes so good.

888
00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:16.240
Have some more.

889
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:17.240
It's okay. I'll help myself.

890
00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:17.810
And this.

891
00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:18.330
I'll help…

892
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:19.010
And this.

893
00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:19.850
I'll help myself.

894
00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:20.330
Thank you.

895
00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.160
Thanks. Thank you.

896
00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:21.680
Ms. Nie,

897
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:22.520
how is it going

898
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.600
with your shop?

899
00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:24.680
Very well.

900
00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:26.200
But I've been trying to figure out

901
00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:27.970
how I can boost

902
00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:29.160
foot traffic to my shop.

903
00:37:29.290 --> 00:37:30.520
Since my shop has just opened,

904
00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.560
many people don't even know about it.

905
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.640
So, I'm thinking

906
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.200
how I can

907
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:34.410
make my shop known

908
00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.410
and promote my business.

909
00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.520
I need to figure out a plan.

910
00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.720
How can I…

911
00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:15.930
Your Lordship, you are back.

912
00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:17.640
Have you had dinner?

913
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:19.450
Dinner?

914
00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.080
What dinner?

915
00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:22.890
Eating is all she can think about.

916
00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:25.560
From the capital to Haifang,

917
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.520
hasn't she eaten enough?

918
00:38:28.770 --> 00:38:29.810
Your Lordship, you and Her Ladyship…

919
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:30.330
Nothing.

920
00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:34.560
I'm fine.

921
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:36.770
Then…

922
00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.370
Gui Bai, let me ask you.

923
00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.010
Is it quiet and boring in this residence?

924
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.520
Was it quiet and boring

925
00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.810
in my mansion back in the capital?

926
00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:48.720
Is it boring

927
00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:52.560
to be with me?

928
00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.240
A little bit.

929
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.010
Even you think this way.

930
00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.600
You want me to lie?

931
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.770
She thinks I'm boring…

932
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.560
In that case, I'll do something

933
00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.330
to make this place lively.

934
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.010
Gui Bai,

935
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.040
serve me some dishes.

936
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:34.450
I'll eat.

937
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:41.720
Your Lordship,

938
00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:44.080
I thought you wanted to eat.

939
00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.890
What are you waiting for?

940
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:50.160
Her Ladyship?

941
00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:56.720
Ning Yuxuan.

942
00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.770
Ning Yuxuan, I'm back.

943
00:39:58.890 --> 00:39:59.600
You are full, right?

944
00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.720
Gui Bai, clean up the table.

945
00:40:01.850 --> 00:40:02.330
Yes.

946
00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.010
Go ahead and clean it up.

947
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:04.850
I brought you

948
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:05.600
a lot of food back.

949
00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.200
Gui Bai,

950
00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:07.490
stop.

951
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:14.930
Look,

952
00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:15.930
this is your favorite

953
00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:16.770
pork chop and preserved sausage.

954
00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:18.490
And this is the beef from the Yao's.

955
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:19.720
And this,

956
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.370
roast goose.

957
00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:22.770
Oh, right.

958
00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:23.600
Look,

959
00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:24.810
I almost forgot.

960
00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:27.120
It's the last

961
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.330
plate of smoked fish,

962
00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:29.600
and I brought it back for you.

963
00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.520
And this is your favorite

964
00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.490
rice porridge with jujube and almond.

965
00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.970
Nice, right?

966
00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.010
I'm exhausted.

967
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:36.520
Good for you.

968
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.010
You went to so many

969
00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.330
places with him.

970
00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.810
I didn't.

971
00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.240
I came back in a hurry

972
00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:52.850
to bring you the food.

973
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:05.890
Some people just can't help

974
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.010
acting cool even when

975
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.720
they are jealous.

976
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.010
Who said I was jealous?

977
00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.810
That's a lie.

978
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:27.600
Ning Yuxuan,

979
00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.890
here's something strange.

980
00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:29.560
When I walked out

981
00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.450
of the antique store just now,

982
00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.080
that female owner

983
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.410
recognized me right away,

984
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.970
and she said

985
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.680
she'd like

986
00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:36.040
to keep in touch with me

987
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.410
and hang out with me.

988
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:38.600
She also said she'd buy

989
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:39.890
all my Feiwan Face Cream.

990
00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.080
Come to think of it,

991
00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.680
something's not right.

992
00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:45.010
I've never met her before.

993
00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.640
How did she recognize me right away?

994
00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:48.330
Something's going on.

995
00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:51.290
Maybe it has something to do
with Wang Jinyao.

996
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:55.770
Gui Bai,

997
00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:58.120
keep an eye on that store.

998
00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:58.770
Yes.

999
00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.040
Since I'm this smart,

1000
00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:09.330
I can be of help to you, right?

1001
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.040
By the way,

1002
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:20.930
when I walked out

1003
00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:21.600
of the antique store,

1004
00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:22.810
I passed by their backyard.

1005
00:42:22.930 --> 00:42:23.560
And something

1006
00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:24.810
smelled so good.

1007
00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:25.450
Turns out,

1008
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.810
the backyard is filled

1009
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:27.490
with rare

1010
00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.330
and unique flowers.

1011
00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:29.040
You know?

1012
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:30.640
That's why it smells so pleasantly

1013
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:31.890
outside the store.

1014
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.770
Especially when there's a breeze,

1015
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:36.370
it smells so nice.
