=Episode 15=

3
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.050
Since you've just arrived,

4
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.960
you should get some rest first.

5
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.720
In a few days,

6
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.410
I'll take you

7
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.440
to the market in Haifang.

8
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.410
There are a lot of

9
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.080
interesting things there.

10
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.210
Really, Sangyu?

11
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.440
Take me there soon.

12
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.770
I can't wait.

13
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.160
By the way, Miss Xue,

14
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.010
your room

15
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.440
hasn't been cleaned yet.

16
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.360
We can share a room.

17
00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.210
Okay.

18
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.080
Miss Wen?

19
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.320
Sangyu, you're back.

20
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.040
When did you come?

21
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.690
I just arrived at noon, Sangyu.

22
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.300
After His Lordship sent me back

23
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.880
to the Magistrate's Residence,

24
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.410
he went to do official duties.

25
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.010
Busybody.

26
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.530
Qingyun.

27
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.480
Qingyun, you've had a long day.

28
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.480
I've booked a quality room

29
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.370
for you at the inn.

30
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.290
General Tao lives next door to you.

31
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.370
Miss Xue.

32
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.880
I've also cleaned up

33
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.690
the room you are going to live in

34
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.130
with servants.

35
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.410
Look.

36
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.570
You're hungry, aren't you?

37
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.200
I was afraid that the food here
didn't agree with His Lordship,

38
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.720
so I brought the cook
of the Marquis's Mansion

39
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.010
to Haifang.

40
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.440
I'll ask him to cook something

41
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.250
for you later.

42
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.970
Well, Sangyu.

43
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.010
I helped you

44
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.720
clean up your room.

45
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.530
But your sheets

46
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.410
are worn.

47
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.320
Please sleep on them for the night.

48
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.160
Tomorrow,

49
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.130
I'll get you a new one.

50
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.570
Thank you.

51
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.780
Come on.

52
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.940
Take a rest.

53
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.700
Come on.

54
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.100
You guys, go.

55
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.540
Do your work.

56
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.780
You prepare the meal.

57
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.100
You prepare hot water.

58
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.980
And you,

59
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.940
prepare the tea.

60
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.460
His Lordship will be back any moment.

61
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.340
Make sure

62
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.500
he gets a hot meal

63
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.540
when he returns.

64
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.780
Do you get it?

65
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.500
- Yes.
- Yes.

66
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.100
Your Lordship.

67
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.180
Why are you here?

68
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.900
Since you were demoted,

69
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.780
I have been worried.

70
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.220
Miss Xue and the others came to Haifang

71
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:09.620
in such a hurry

72
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.100
that they forgot to inform me,

73
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.100
so I came in a carriage by myself.

74
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:16.660
Your Lordship.

75
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.020
You aren't mad at me,

76
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.260
are you?

77
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.820
Gui Bai.

78
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.460
Arrange a room for Miss Wen.

79
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.260
No need.

80
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.140
I've already arranged a room for myself.

81
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.820
And I prepared the meal

82
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.260
and tea for you.

83
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.820
Never mind.

84
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.820
Your Lordship.

85
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.780
It's my first time here.

86
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.660
Would you like to hang out

87
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:47.700
with me tomorrow?

88
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.700
Tomorrow?

89
00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.820
Tomorrow I'll do official business.

90
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.780
When I was cleaning the room
for Her Ladyship today,

91
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.380
I found the bed sheets of hers

92
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.700
were worn.

93
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.460
I wanted Your Lordship

94
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.780
to accompany me

95
00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.700
only to choose one piece
of comfortable new cloth

96
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.900
for Her Ladyship.

97
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.900
I can't bear to see

98
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.580
Her Ladyship so...

99
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.460
New cloth?

100
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.780
Thanks, Your Lordship.

101
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.340
I...

102
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:27.900
It's delicious.

103
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.900
Right?

104
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.700
Yes.

105
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.900
I'll buy it next time.

106
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.780
Your Ladyship.

107
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.340
(Linglong Cloth Shop)
Let's select the cloth.

108
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.460
The ones brought from the capital
are worn out.

109
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.940
Let's go.

110
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:40.500
This one.

111
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.140
This one is good.

112
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.580
That's right.

113
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.340
Your Lordship.

114
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.340
What do you think?

115
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.340
Too showy. Not a good one for the sheet.

116
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.700
How about

117
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.220
others?

118
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.700
Your Ladyship, I'll call His Lordship.

119
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.500
Forget it. Let's go home.

120
00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.780
I think

121
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.380
it's suitable

122
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.260
to make a dress.

123
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.340
If Her Ladyship wears this

124
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.140
with a pair of baby-blue satin shoes,

125
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.940
she will be

126
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.580
attracting.

127
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.700
My mother had taught me

128
00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:09.940
since I was young that

129
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.780
even if women are married,

130
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.820
they must

131
00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.020
dress themselves beautifully.

132
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.940
Then their husband will be happy.

133
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.780
Are you choosing one piece
of cloth for a dress?

134
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.100
Your wife has good taste.

135
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.580
This cloth is the finest one

136
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.660
in our shop.

137
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.820
It's suitable

138
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.100
for your wife's skin.

139
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.900
Sir, you misunderstood.

140
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:29.340
Your...

141
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.500
Your Ladyship.

142
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:48.460
Are you sure you won't go
to the restaurant

143
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.380
to have dinner with Mr. Qin?

144
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:51.820
Yes. Yes.

145
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.340
Tell them I'm upset.

146
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:01.460
Why do you think

147
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.020
I get so upset

148
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.140
when I see

149
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.850
Miss Wen?

150
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.140
I hate

151
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.900
playing tricks with them.

152
00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.260
I see.

153
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.020
You're jealous.

154
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.140
I'm not.

155
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.580
You said no, but you don't mean it.

156
00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.340
Your Ladyship.

157
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.140
Follow your heart.

158
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.380
But.

159
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:27.900
Miss Wen is not

160
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.340
a kind woman.

161
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.660
Your Ladyship.

162
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.900
Gui Bai.

163
00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.700
Your Ladyship.

164
00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.800
This is the cloth that

165
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.110
His Lordship selected for you by himself.

166
00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.100
I don't want anything from him.

167
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:50.380
Give it back to him.

168
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.140
But...

169
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.020
Your Lordship.

170
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:10.820
Sangyu didn't receive it?

171
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.460
Muxu said

172
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.900
Her Ladyship didn't eat dinner

173
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:15.380
and didn't go to the party

174
00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.260
with Miss Xue.

175
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.100
I heard from Muxu that

176
00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.020
Her Ladyship was jealous.

177
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:22.940
Jealous?

178
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.340
That's not the reason

179
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.020
to refuse to eat dinner.

180
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.180
I can't believe her.

181
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:13.940
It's already so late.

182
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.220
What can I do for you?

183
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.700
Why don't you eat dinner?

184
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:17.940
I'm in no mood.

185
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.180
Sit down and eat your meal.

186
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.460
What is it?

187
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.700
Is it safe to eat?

188
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.580
His Lordship made it for you,
Your Ladyship.

189
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:46.540
Noodles.

190
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.340
Noodles.

191
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:50.700
It's noodles.

192
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.180
Did you cook it?

193
00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:54.700
Have a try.

194
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:01.980
Okay.

195
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:05.740
(Shouldn't)

196
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.220
(noodles be strips?)

197
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.420
(Why is it all broken now?)

198
00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.620
(Didn't he know that)

199
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.060
(salt could just be put in a little?)

200
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.820
How does it taste?

201
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.220
The truth?

202
00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.300
Yes.

203
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:28.620
A little salty.

204
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:32.940
I...

205
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.700
I didn't know much about it

206
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.540
when I cooked it for the first time,

207
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.220
and then I boiled it into noodle soup.

208
00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.300
Then on my second try,

209
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.420
I didn't control the heat well,

210
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.340
and the noodles were undercooked.

211
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:39.940
This...

212
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:43.700
Then...

213
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.620
This is my third try.

214
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.580
But... It's salty.

215
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:53.340
Your Lordship.

216
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:55.100
Her Ladyship has entered the door.

217
00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.740
You... You...

218
00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:10.340
It's your first time making noodles,
isn't it?

219
00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:16.620
For me?

220
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:18.700
Yes.

221
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.060
No.

222
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:28.820
Now I think

223
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:29.980
it tastes good.

224
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:33.580
Have a try.

225
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:39.700
How does it taste?

226
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.940
Here's some more for you.

227
00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.100
I'd better remake a bowl of noodles.

228
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.220
Give me.

229
00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:47.220
These are the best noodles I've ever had.

230
00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.220
Delicious.

231
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:53.820
Have a try.

232
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.300
Good. Good.

233
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.180
One more bite.

234
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.700
Did you say that

235
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:10.220
His Lordship made noodles

236
00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:12.820
for Nie Sangyu?

237
00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:14.740
Yes, Miss Wen.

238
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.580
Why?

239
00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.220
I have nothing

240
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.740
but you.

241
00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:52.580
This...

242
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.820
I want you all out there.

243
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.340
- Yes, sir.
- Don't touch me. Get out.

244
00:13:59.220 --> 00:13:59.860
Miss Wen.

245
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.340
Mr. Ning.

246
00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.700
I was angry with my father

247
00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.620
and ran out alone.

248
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:15.700
I didn't expect to meet bandits.

249
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.180
They dragged me here.

250
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:19.980
I couldn't resist them.

251
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.460
They raped me.

252
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:35.460
What belongs to me

253
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.180
must be mine.

254
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:42.740
No one

255
00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.100
can take him away from me.

256
00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:56.180
Your Ladyship.

257
00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.620
His Lordship was cold.

258
00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:58.820
But today he made noodles

259
00:14:58.940 --> 00:14:59.820
for you.

260
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.580
I often hear Miss Xue say that

261
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.700
the sincerest thing is not a man
to pay lots of money for you,

262
00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.460
not make some oath,

263
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.820
but do a small thing

264
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.220
to impress you.

265
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.980
He is not that bad.

266
00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:13.940
But

267
00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.420
it would be even better

268
00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:17.940
if his cooking could improve.

269
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.180
Stop.

270
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:35.300
It's the barrack.

271
00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:36.740
No one is allowed in.

272
00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:38.420
I'm here

273
00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.940
to see General Tao.

274
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:41.580
We haven't received a passing order

275
00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.460
of General Tao's visitors today.

276
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.060
Please show me

277
00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.100
your visiting permit.

278
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:47.460
I know.

279
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.220
But

280
00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:49.580
I'm a friend of General Tao.

281
00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.580
Please report to him.

282
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.580
I'm Miss Nie.

283
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.100
He will let me in.

284
00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.540
Please wait for a while.

285
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.220
Make it quick.

286
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:04.980
The tail of the arrow

287
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.460
should be stuck in the finger socket

288
00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.340
of the thumb and forefinger.

289
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.100
String the bow.

290
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.700
Aim.

291
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:11.940
Lower shoulders.

292
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.340
Marvelous!

293
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:18.940
Practice more.

294
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:20.100
Yes, sir.

295
00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:22.100
General Tao.

296
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.460
What?

297
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.980
There's a friend of you

298
00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:26.340
at the barrack entrance.

299
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.100
Would you like to see her?

300
00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:30.300
Friend?

301
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.460
A woman.

302
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.460
Watch your tone.

303
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.100
Say it all at once.

304
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.620
It's Miss Nie.

305
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.860
She is waiting at the entrance.

306
00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.580
Miss Nie?

307
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:51.860
It's the barrack.

308
00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.300
No one is allowed in.

309
00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.980
(Shuiyan House)

310
00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.100
Jog on.

311
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.020
Jog on.

312
00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.140
Excuse.

313
00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.500
My name is Lianxiang.

314
00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.180
(Lianxiang)
I want to take refuge in Miss Shui.

315
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:19.580
Come with me.

316
00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.660
What? He didn't want to see me?

317
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:25.540
Did you tell him

318
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.500
who I am?

319
00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.340
Nie. I'm Miss Nie.

320
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:29.580
I told him.

321
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.780
General Tao didn't want to see you.

322
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.420
I...

323
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.020
(General Tao didn't want to see me.)

324
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:38.820
(Why?)

325
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.260
(No way.)

326
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.620
(I must see him.)

327
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.060
You play the lute very well.

328
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.740
And you're beautiful.

329
00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:17.860
Miss Wang

330
00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.340
is my friend in the capital.

331
00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.540
Since she wrote a letter
to recommend you,

332
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.060
you can stay in Shuiyan House
in the future.

333
00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:29.540
Thank you

334
00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.660
very much.

335
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:34.660
It's a bad day for all of us.

336
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:35.660
We're supposed to

337
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.340
help each other out.

338
00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:38.420
Come on.

339
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:40.380
Stand up.

340
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:46.260
What's wrong with you?

341
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.740
Haifang is humid.

342
00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.260
I'm not used to the climate here

343
00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:53.020
as a newcomer.

344
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.580
I have old scars.

345
00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:56.580
It hurts now.

346
00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.340
Let me see.

347
00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.020
What happened?

348
00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:11.340
I...

349
00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:14.580
I...

350
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.500
I see. I won't ask.

351
00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:18.820
I know

352
00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:19.740
the Feiwan Face Cream is helpful

353
00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.340
for your scars.

354
00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:22.820
I'll ask for one for you.

355
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.820
Thank you, Miss Shui.

356
00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:31.620
Lianxiang.

357
00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:32.340
You are one of us

358
00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:33.980
in Shuiyan House.

359
00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:35.420
I'll protect you.

360
00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.180
No one will bully you.

361
00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.580
How could you be so careless?

362
00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:46.980
Luckily, your bones are fine.

363
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:49.260
I'll ask the medical officer
to give you some medicine.

364
00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.140
Wait for a while.

365
00:19:50.580 --> 00:19:51.140
Wait.

366
00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:53.180
I...

367
00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.100
I don't want those medical officers
to touch me.

368
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.860
Could you help me?

369
00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.820
The medical officers
in the barrack are superb.

370
00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:02.580
I'm relieved to have them

371
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:03.580
heal you.

372
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:05.580
Come back.

373
00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.820
Are you trying to avoid me?

374
00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.340
I...

375
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.820
You knew it was me before.

376
00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:20.820
You just didn't want to see me, right?

377
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:22.380
Why?

378
00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:23.180
You must

379
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.740
tell me the reason today.

380
00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:32.780
Qingyun.

381
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.020
I'm older than you.

382
00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:36.380
I should be more careful
about the boundaries

383
00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.740
between men and women.

384
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.860
I have to protect your reputation.

385
00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.100
I always see you

386
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.100
as my little sister.

387
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.420
I don't want people to misunderstand

388
00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:43.660
the relationship between you and me.

389
00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:45.300
Who will misunderstand?

390
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:49.860
I'm just afraid.

391
00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.340
So what?

392
00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.340
What?

393
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.100
I said

394
00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.340
I'm willing to be misunderstood.

395
00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.420
I'm willing to let you
cross the boundary.

396
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.580
I don't want to

397
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.580
be your little sister.

398
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:21.420
General Tao.

399
00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.100
I like you.

400
00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.380
So... What about you?

401
00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:36.180
I... I... I...

402
00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:37.620
Qingyun. Qingyun.

403
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.380
You... You may have misunderstood.

404
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.620
In my heart, you...

405
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.100
You're my sister.

406
00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.540
I have no feelings for you.

407
00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:53.660
Don't you feel anything

408
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:54.900
for me?

409
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:01.740
Or do you have someone else

410
00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.100
you like?

411
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:08.180
Who? From which family?

412
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:08.980
Do I know her?

413
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:09.740
Don't ask me.

414
00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.580
I can't explain much to you.

415
00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.820
You're Sangyu's sister.

416
00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.900
Everyone dotes on you.

417
00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.260
So I can't lie to you,

418
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:18.820
hurt you,

419
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:19.980
and let alone detain you.

420
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.580
I hope you can understand.

421
00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.740
So you've always been kind to me,

422
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.140
tolerated me, put up with me,

423
00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.060
just because

424
00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.180
I'm Sangyu's sister?

425
00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:36.580
You think I'm a little girl

426
00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.620
who needs to be taken care of.

427
00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:39.820
You never thought of me as a woman,

428
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.660
right?

429
00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:44.140
Qingyun.

430
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:46.740
I'm sorry.

431
00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.420
No, you don't need to apologize.

432
00:22:56.300 --> 00:22:57.820
I was being sentimental.

433
00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:59.340
Sorry to bother you.

434
00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:00.340
Goodbye.

435
00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.340
Be careful.

436
00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:04.580
It's not your business.

437
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.820
Here you are. Your products.

438
00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:15.300
They're wrapped.

439
00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:15.660
Thank you.

440
00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.100
There is the exit.

441
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.340
Okay. Okay.

442
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:22.140
You can see this one.

443
00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.100
It's good.

444
00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:23.860
This one?

445
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:25.100
Are there any other products?

446
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:25.900
Ms. Nie.

447
00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.180
Miss Shui, perfect timing.

448
00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.260
I made two new creams

449
00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.020
these days.

450
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.260
Have a try.

451
00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.500
I'll give you more if you use it well.

452
00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.820
I have something...

453
00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.140
And

454
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.260
I have a new idea.

455
00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.580
Come on. Have a seat.

456
00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:41.820
What?

457
00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.140
I'd like to

458
00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:44.820
bring together

459
00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.060
the new and old customers

460
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.340
of Haoxue Cosmetics

461
00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.260
and let everyone

462
00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:49.380
exchange their ideas

463
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:50.420
and opinions.

464
00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.740
I want to see what Haoxue Cosmetics

465
00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.020
needs to improve.

466
00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.620
The main aim is

467
00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.740
to promote our new product

468
00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:57.860
to them.

469
00:23:58.660 --> 00:23:59.900
I don't know

470
00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.740
you're so business-minded.

471
00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.260
Well...

472
00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:06.020
Please

473
00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.580
help me

474
00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:09.100
spread the news.

475
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:10.860
No problem.

476
00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.180
I'll do my best

477
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.860
to help you.

478
00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.660
Thank you.

479
00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.660
Forget that.

480
00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.420
I have something to say.

481
00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:22.820
What? Tell me.

482
00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:24.340
We have a new girl

483
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.500
in Shuiyan House.

484
00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.100
She was abused by the master

485
00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:27.740
she served before.

486
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:29.140
There are many scars on her body.

487
00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.820
I want to buy some Feiwan Face Cream

488
00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.860
to recover her scars.

489
00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.860
You regarded me as an outsider.

490
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:36.260
I won't charge you.

491
00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:36.820
Well,

492
00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:37.900
I'll give you two bowls

493
00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:39.060
of old Scar Recovering Cream.

494
00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:40.340
Because the new Feiwan Face Cream

495
00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:40.980
has not been produced.

496
00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:41.740
This is helpful

497
00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:42.780
to recover scars.

498
00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.510
I'm afraid it's not enough.

499
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:47.740
Not enough?

500
00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:50.820
How many injuries did she suffer?

501
00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:52.580
I've checked.

502
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:53.860
There were scars of whips

503
00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:54.900
from her arms

504
00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.380
to her back.

505
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.740
What an evil master!

506
00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:01.500
If I met a master

507
00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.340
like that,

508
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:03.620
I'd skin him.

509
00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.100
Well,

510
00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:08.140
I'll give you

511
00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.180
all the old Scar Recovering Cream

512
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.340
in my shop.

513
00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.100
If it's not enough,

514
00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.140
you can tell me,

515
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.340
and I'll send Muxu to the warehouse

516
00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.500
to get some more.

517
00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:17.980
Thank you, Sangyu.

518
00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:18.900
Never mind.

519
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.260
I have to go.

520
00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.500
(Shuiyan House)
Have a look.

521
00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.500
Congratulations.

522
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.780
Please.

523
00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:32.420
- Congratulations.
- Please come in.

524
00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:33.340
Come in. Please.

525
00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.060
Thank you. Thanks.

526
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.900
Please.

527
00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.380
- Thank you. Please.
- Come in.

528
00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:39.260
- Please.
- Congratulations.

529
00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.340
Please. Come in.

530
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.380
You look better than before.

531
00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.500
Have a seat.

532
00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:45.020
There you are.

533
00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:46.300
You look so happy today.

534
00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.100
It seems that

535
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.300
this trade fair is successful.

536
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.420
Sure.

537
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:50.580
I think

538
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.340
from now on,

539
00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:51.980
the business in Haoxue Cosmetics

540
00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.180
will be better.

541
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:54.820
You're right.

542
00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.020
Sangyu.

543
00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.020
Mr. Yuan.

544
00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:59.620
Congratulations.

545
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.780
A little gift for you.

546
00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.100
You're too kind.

547
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:03.620
Muxu.

548
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.580
Isn't this Mr. Ning?

549
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.340
What a coincidence.

550
00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.020
What a coincidence.

551
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:13.820
How lucky.

552
00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:15.340
Exactly.

553
00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:17.860
Why?

554
00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:20.780
Just a coincidence.

555
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:21.820
Gui Bai.

556
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.260
Guys, you are in the way.

557
00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.140
Mr. Yuan.

558
00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.060
Why don't you go do your own business,

559
00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.100
and come to Shuiyan House instead?

560
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.140
Sangyu invited me.

561
00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:49.740
As her former partner,

562
00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:51.020
I must be here.

563
00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:52.500
You have good taste.

564
00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:53.900
But you're late.

565
00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:56.580
The past is gone. It's not too late
to cherish the present.

566
00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.420
What is early? What is late?

567
00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:00.100
It's hard to say.

568
00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.500
Mr. Yuan, you seem to be hopeful

569
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.340
about everything.

570
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.740
It's always better to be optimistic.

571
00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:09.100
Being optimistic is good.

572
00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.100
But being over-optimistic

573
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.340
is wrong.

574
00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.860
I've asked General Tao

575
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:18.540
to tour patrol tonight.

576
00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.300
If the Dragon Gang takes any action,

577
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.660
it will be attacked.

578
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.100
Mr. Ning.

579
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:30.660
I'm a normal businessman.

580
00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:33.420
I have nothing to do
with the Dragon Gang.

581
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:35.100
But

582
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:36.140
I would advise you

583
00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:37.060
to keep an eye

584
00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.340
on the people present.

585
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:47.860
Watch out.

586
00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:49.660
There can't be any trouble

587
00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:51.260
tonight.

588
00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:51.820
Yes, sir.

589
00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.860
Great.

590
00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.580
Distinguished...

591
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:17.500
Distinguished guests,

592
00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.320
you're all

593
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.290
my honoured clients.

594
00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:23.260
So I invited you

595
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.140
to gather in Shuiyan House

596
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.620
to chat and drink tea,

597
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.220
and listen to the songs.

598
00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.060
Well,

599
00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.540
I also prepared a small surprise

600
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:32.180
for you.

601
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.820
Now I want to introduce you

602
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.180
what is it.

603
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:36.560
This is

604
00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.660
the new product of Haoxue Cosmetics.

605
00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:40.180
Shuilan Face Cream.

606
00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.180
Shuilan Face Cream?

607
00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.700
What is it?

608
00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.100
Have a try.

609
00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:45.500
It smells good.

610
00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.820
Smells good, huh?

611
00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:47.940
What does it smell like?

612
00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:48.380
That's it.

613
00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.900
We added some new ingredients.

614
00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:50.660
And one more secret

615
00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:51.660
for you.

616
00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.380
Miss Shui has been using
our new products

617
00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.180
in recent days.

618
00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.620
So in a while,

619
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.860
you can see

620
00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:00.460
the delicate skin on her face

621
00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.860
and her enchanting eyes.

622
00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:04.040
I need to stop here.

623
00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.140
Now let's welcome Miss Shui

624
00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.580
who has become flawless

625
00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.940
after using Shuilan Face Cream

626
00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:11.060
to perform a song for you.

627
00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.550
- Come on.
- Good. Come on.

628
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.340
Ms. Nie, good for you.

629
00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:48.420
Good!

630
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.180
- Good.
- Good. Good.

631
00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.060
Ms. Nie.

632
00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:08.620
Please.

633
00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.500
I'm a little thirsty.

634
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:12.580
Thank you.

635
00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.060
It's hot.

636
00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.180
- Good!
- Good! Good!

637
00:31:29.660 --> 00:31:31.460
Good!

638
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:46.580
You...

639
00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:17.620
Who sent you?

640
00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.740
What do you plan to do at the trade fair?

641
00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:26.460
She is

642
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.860
a masked woman.

643
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.420
She gave me three taels of silver

644
00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:31.900
to throw pig's blood

645
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.220
at the trade fair.

646
00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.340
Please don't kill me.

647
00:32:58.660 --> 00:32:59.500
Miss Shui.

648
00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:00.260
How about it?

649
00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:01.420
Are you satisfied with my arrangement?

650
00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:02.420
Of course.

651
00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.190
That's great.

652
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.620
I'm enchanted by your song.

653
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.510
The lute woman

654
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:06.410
behind you

655
00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.180
played so well.

656
00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:08.700
I'll invite you

657
00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:09.410
next time

658
00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:10.280
to perform.

659
00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.100
This is Lianxiang. I told you before.

660
00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:13.520
She was a servant

661
00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.660
with a miserable life.

662
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:16.150
She is my new favorite girl.

663
00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.380
She plays the lute so well.

664
00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.820
If you want to hear it next time,

665
00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.140
I'll bring her to play it for you.

666
00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:26.980
What's wrong with her arm?

667
00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:32.740
Lianxiang.

668
00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:33.660
I'm wrong, Your Ladyship.

669
00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.060
I should not appear

670
00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:36.340
in front of you.

671
00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.980
I'm sorry.

672
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:40.500
I was forced to wander

673
00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.260
from the capital to Haifang.

674
00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.980
I shouldn't have stained
Your Ladyship's eyes.

675
00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:45.780
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

676
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:46.780
I'm sorry.

677
00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:47.900
- Lianxiang, Lianxiang, stand up.
- Stand up.

678
00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:49.140
It's okay. Tell me.

679
00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.060
What happened, Lianxiang?

680
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:50.740
What's wrong?

681
00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.580
What's wrong?

682
00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:52.900
Tell me.

683
00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:53.900
What's wrong?

684
00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.460
Miss Shui.

685
00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:57.500
Do you remember

686
00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:58.940
I told you that

687
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.900
I was sold

688
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:02.140
by my former master?

689
00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.180
It was Mrs. Ning

690
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.060
who drove me out of the capital.

691
00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.740
That's not good.

692
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.820
Find a chance to take her away.

693
00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.380
Yes, sir.

694
00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.860
Miss Shui.

695
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.860
I only brought tea

696
00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:24.940
to His Lordship once

697
00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.860
when I was in Ning's Mansion.

698
00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.100
After Her Ladyship knew about it,

699
00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.100
she punished me with five lashes.

700
00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.740
She said I was foxy

701
00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:33.060
and flirtatious.

702
00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:35.900
And she thought I must have
seduced His Lordship.

703
00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:37.180
Her Ladyship asked me

704
00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:39.620
to wear a veil at the Mansion

705
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.700
and never enter the room
of His Lordship.

706
00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:44.300
This may be a misunderstanding.

707
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.380
Please stand up.

708
00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:46.420
Get out!

709
00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:47.540
- Stand up.
- Get out!

710
00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.300
This has nothing to do with her.

711
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.100
I'll explain it to you.

712
00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:52.620
Your Lordship.

713
00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.260
You said nothing to do with her?

714
00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.380
Nothing?

715
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:02.820
Nothing?

716
00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:05.860
I'll show you

717
00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.660
my scars!

718
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:19.700
Your Ladyship.

719
00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.780
The other day,

720
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.620
when I was helping you
get some drawing paper,

721
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.740
I met His Lordship by accident,

722
00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:29.700
and you ordered someone to beat me.

723
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.180
You couldn't get over it.

724
00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.460
So you had me hang on the back
of a wagon.

725
00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:36.300
The frightened horse

726
00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:39.740
dragged me for two blocks.

727
00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.060
Your Ladyship.

728
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.320
Until a kind person

729
00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.710
rescued me,

730
00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.140
I barely had

731
00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.140
a piece of good skin.

732
00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.100
But you...

733
00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.860
You were still mad at me.

734
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.900
You ordered someone

735
00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:57.180
to send me to the traffickers that night

736
00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:59.020
and asked him to sell me

737
00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:02.540
as far away as possible.

738
00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.180
I spent three years in a brothel.

739
00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:08.380
Life was worse than death.

740
00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:11.580
Later, when I went to Haifang

741
00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:13.780
and met Miss Shui,

742
00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.620
I thought

743
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:16.980
I could finally

744
00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.610
live a stable life.

745
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:20.580
But I didn't expect

746
00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:22.660
Your Ladyship

747
00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:25.140
still found me.

748
00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:26.880
I'm not looking for you.

749
00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.530
- I'm not looking for you.
- Your Ladyship.

750
00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:29.530
I'm not.

751
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:30.790
It has something to do
with the Ning family.

752
00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.860
If the Ning family made a mistake,

753
00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.340
I would be responsible for it.

754
00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.700
You go to the back hall with Gui Bai.

755
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.540
I'll explain all of it

756
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.580
to you.

757
00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:41.860
Don't touch me!

758
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.620
Get out. Get out. Get out.

759
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.260
Lianxiang. Lianxiang.

760
00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.970
- Get out. Get out.
- Lianxiang.

761
00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:53.020
Get out.

762
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.780
Get out. Get out.

763
00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:55.660
Lianxiang.

764
00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:56.940
Get out!

765
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.660
Even if I fled to the ends
of the earth,

766
00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:01.840
I was still found by you.

767
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.390
I'm just a nobody.

768
00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:06.080
I'll give my life to you today.

769
00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.620
I will never suffer from you again.

770
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:08.760
- No!
- Sangyu, be careful.

771
00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.020
That's okay. That's okay.

772
00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.260
It's okay.

773
00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:14.420
It's okay, Lianxiang.

774
00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.380
You're evil.

775
00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:17.700
Is your Shuilan Face Cream

776
00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:19.060
also toxic?

777
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:19.620
I will throw everything

778
00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:20.420
I bought from your store.

779
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.660
All of them.

780
00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.260
That's right. Evil woman.

781
00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.460
No.

782
00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:25.140
Throw all of them.

783
00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:25.740
No.

784
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:26.540
Stop it.

785
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:27.300
Calm down.

786
00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.100
There must be some mistake.

787
00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:28.900
No.

788
00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:29.900
That's not true.

789
00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:31.580
No.

790
00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.780
Don't scold her

791
00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:34.100
before you know the situation.

792
00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:36.220
Calm down.

793
00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:38.300
It must have been a misunderstanding.

794
00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:40.060
Calm down.

795
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.260
Shut up!

796
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:45.820
Never mind.

797
00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:47.420
Let's get out of here.

798
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:48.780
No.

799
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.480
I had a serious illness in the capital,

800
00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:53.100
so when I woke up,

801
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:54.310
I had no memories.

802
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:55.460
That's true.

803
00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:57.580
My memory has not yet been restored.

804
00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.440
I really don't remember

805
00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.740
anything about

806
00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:01.820
what you just said.

807
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:03.870
How can there be such a disease

808
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:05.150
in the world?

809
00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.090
It's true.

810
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.230
You can ask him.

811
00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:09.350
He knew.

812
00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.710
Everyone in the Ning family

813
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:12.250
knew I had this disease.

814
00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.830
I didn't lie to you.

815
00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:15.530
Sangyu does have this disease.

816
00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:16.050
But...

817
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:23.290
I'll apologize to you.

818
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:24.790
- I'm sorry.
- Sangyu.

819
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.590
Sorry.

820
00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.480
Sorry?

821
00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.120
If apologies work,

822
00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:33.080
what's the law for?

823
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.580
Will all the evil

824
00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.180
you've done be undone

825
00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.540
by this apology?

826
00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.980
Will people who have been burned,
beaten,

827
00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.230
and branded by you before

828
00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.020
forgive you

829
00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.230
simply for this apology?

830
00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.230
Well, what can I do

831
00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:01.090
to make you forgive me?

832
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:06.530
I want you to kneel down

833
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:08.300
and beg for my forgiveness.

834
00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:09.490
Lianxiang.

835
00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:11.870
If you don't,

836
00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:14.450
I'll hate you all the time.

837
00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:16.780
Your Ladyship, no.

838
00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:18.340
You're a titled lady.

839
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.260
You can't kneel to her.

840
00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:22.220
No, Your Ladyship.

841
00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.780
She must do this.

842
00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:24.740
She deserves it.

843
00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.380
It's too good for her.

844
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.660
Come on. Sing a song.

845
00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.740
Kidney bean fritter.

846
00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.100
Nie Sangyu is my enemy.

847
00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.300
I'll listen to you.

848
00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:56.660
Don't worry. I'll take revenge for you.

849
00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.620
Nie Sangyu.

850
00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.740
I'll make you infamous

851
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:07.740
in Haifang.

852
00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.500
I'm kneeling at you.

853
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:12.740
No.

854
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.780
Sangyu, no.

855
00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:14.780
Stand up.

856
00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:16.380
Lianxiang.

857
00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.660
If you really think

858
00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:18.820
that can relieve your hatred,

859
00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:21.390
I will do it.

860
00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:23.060
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

861
00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.380
We are married.

862
00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.020
It's my duty.

863
00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.140
I...

864
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.980
It's my fault.

865
00:40:34.100 --> 00:40:35.380
I'll take it.

866
00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.260
I'll take the blame

867
00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:38.660
for her mistakes.

868
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.060
Whether it's recovering your scars

869
00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:40.740
or compensating you,

870
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:41.780
I will do it.

871
00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.300
I'll kneel for her.

872
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.220
Please forgive her.

873
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:47.760
- Lianxiang.
- I...

874
00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:54.820
You can't kneel.

875
00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.260
If you kneel,

876
00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.740
what will the people
in the capital think of you?

877
00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.180
You'll

878
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:01.620
be disgraced.

879
00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:03.740
It's

880
00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.380
all my faults.

881
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.100
