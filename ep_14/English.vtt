00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.980
=Episode 14=

3
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.410
Sir.

4
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.090
Don't move.

5
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.160
This is called Feihai dart.

6
00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.440
It can only be removed

7
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.570
by a special tool.

8
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.290
I'm fine.

9
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.480
Why hasn't anyone come yet?

10
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.160
Mr. Nie.

11
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.410
Mr. Nie.

12
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.600
Madam Wu?

13
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.880
Where's Miss Shui?

14
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.850
I'm so sorry

15
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.130
for keeping you waiting.

16
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.920
Something happened to our store.

17
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.760
Miss Shui won't be able to see you today.

18
00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.980
Well,

19
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.700
why don't you go back today?

20
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.620
How about this,

21
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.500
I'll leave the samples here,

22
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.060
is that okay?

23
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.660
Okay. You can give them to me.

24
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.060
Okay.

25
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.340
There are two samples.

26
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.620
Thank you, Mr. Nie.

27
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.980
I'll be waiting for you two

28
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.100
at Haoxue Cosmetics.

29
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.500
Okay, Mr. Nie.

30
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.780
The Feihai dart

31
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.980
is only used by pirates

32
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.940
with spikes on it.

33
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.220
If you try to pull it out recklessly,

34
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.660
your injury will only get worse.

35
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.980
I'll apply some medicine to you.

36
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.460
It might hurt a bit.

37
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.900
Bear it.

38
00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.980
Sir.

39
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.500
Sir.

40
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.260
Why is the blood black?

41
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.700
There is poison on the dart.

42
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.820
Sir.

43
00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.460
Sir.

44
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.140
Sir! Sir!

45
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.900
Muxu.

46
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.500
Wake up.

47
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.340
Sir, what would you like to buy?

48
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.340
It's me, Muxu.

49
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.900
Your Ladyship.

50
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.240
Yes.

51
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.020
You...

52
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.900
You're dressed like...

53
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.900
I went out on an errand.

54
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.700
Did we have any customers today?

55
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.140
There were some customers here.

56
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:46.020
Really?

57
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.900
But I didn't sell anything.

58
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.380
It's okay.

59
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.820
You've worked hard.

60
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.340
Take a break

61
00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.020
and get some rest.

62
00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.900
Really?

63
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.460
What about the store?

64
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.940
I got it.

65
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.580
Go ahead.

66
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.580
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

67
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.020
Buddy.

68
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.500
Where's your boss?

69
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.340
Coming.

70
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.100
Ning Yuxuan.

71
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.020
You...

72
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.220
Why are you dressed like this?

73
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.020
Where did you go?

74
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.580
I went to

75
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.340
Shuiyan House today.

76
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.900
Did you go to Shuiyan House

77
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.900
in such clothes?

78
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.460
What's wrong?

79
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.340
Am I not handsome?

80
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.020
Besides, I met Miss Shui

81
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.460
and conquered her

82
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:46.500
with my charm.

83
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.020
I also left my products there.

84
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.020
Well? Impressive, right?

85
00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.460
What a pervert.

86
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.100
What do you mean?

87
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.100
I...

88
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.500
Mr. Ning.

89
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.100
Mr. Ning.

90
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.140
Miss Shui from Shuiyan House

91
00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.380
has a message for you.

92
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.100
She replied so quickly?

93
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:01.700
What did she say?

94
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.020
Does my product work well?

95
00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.100
No, Miss Shui said

96
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.700
Gui Bai

97
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.820
will stay at her place tonight.

98
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.260
Gui Bai?

99
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.580
Is there anything else?

100
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.020
No.

101
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.260
Okay, I see.

102
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.940
You can leave.

103
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.900
Yes.

104
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.460
Gui Bai also went to Shuiyan House?

105
00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.820
There's something fishy going on.

106
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:52.820
You're awake.

107
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.140
Excuse me, Miss.

108
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.900
Why am I here?

109
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.220
Have you forgotten?

110
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.140
You were poisoned by the Feihai dart

111
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:09.940
and fainted in my arms.

112
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.660
I didn't mean to take advantage of you.

113
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.260
Did you not hear what I said?

114
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.820
I said you were poisoned
by the Feihai dart.

115
00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:26.900
This kind of poisonous dart

116
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:28.820
is only used by the coastal bandits.

117
00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.460
You're lucky that you only fainted.

118
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.380
If I hadn't

119
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.700
cleaned your body,

120
00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.340
you would have died.

121
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.380
Did you clean my body?

122
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.220
Yeah.

123
00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:46.900
I did it to save you.

124
00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:49.820
Miss, what do you want me to do?

125
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.580
I'll be responsible for it.

126
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.660
What should you be responsible for?

127
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.260
I only applied medicine to you.

128
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.140
If everyone

129
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.500
was like you,

130
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:04.820
I wouldn't be able to handle it.

131
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.900
Did you just say the Feihai dart

132
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.780
is a poisonous dart only used by pirates?

133
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.180
No.

134
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.220
I have to go back
and report to His Lordship.

135
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:39.460
You're still injured.

136
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.220
I've sent him a message.

137
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.460
Chief.

138
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.820
Chief, something happened.

139
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.460
Something went wrong.

140
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.540
Hu Da fought with Gui Bai

141
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.820
at Shuiyan House.

142
00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:52.220
What's going on?

143
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:52.940
Hu Da said

144
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:53.980
they were discussing

145
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.340
how to rob Ship Guihai

146
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.940
and someone broke into the room.

147
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.100
He wanted to kill the intruder

148
00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.340
to prevent that person
from leaking the plan.

149
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:00.740
But somehow Gui Bai suddenly showed up

150
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.860
and tried to protect this person.

151
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.820
Who was he trying to protect?

152
00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:04.220
Ning Yuxuan?

153
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.220
It was not Ning Yuxuan,

154
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.460
but Hu Da said

155
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.980
it looked like Mrs. Ning.

156
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:16.100
Nie Sangyu?

157
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.740
Chief.

158
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.860
Ever since this wicked woman

159
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.980
arrived in Haifang,

160
00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.420
she has been causing trouble for me.

161
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.820
She hit me
when she was aiming for Ning Yuxuan

162
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:25.980
and broke into our room

163
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.700
when she was walking around
at Shuiyan House.

164
00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:29.940
Has Ning Yuxuan

165
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.580
found out about our plan?

166
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:32.940
No.

167
00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:34.300
We can't delay any longer.

168
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:35.580
We must take action immediately.

169
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.860
We can't afford

170
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.220
to lose such a juicy target
as Ship Guihai.

171
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.820
I have looked it up.

172
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.420
This dart is called Feihai dart,

173
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.100
which is a poisonous dart
only used by pirates.

174
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.580
Her Ladyship must have overheard

175
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:46.700
their conversation by accident

176
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.460
and that's why they wanted to kill her.

177
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.620
Ship Guihai.

178
00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:54.580
Pirates.

179
00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.940
The Dragon Gang.

180
00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.700
I see.

181
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.100
Please give me your instructions.

182
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.220
The Dragon Gang's surface job

183
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:10.820
is to collect tax to protect the pier,

184
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.220
but they secretly let the pirates

185
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.980
rob the ships that don't pay.

186
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.700
In this case,

187
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:17.100
their next target

188
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.820
should be the leaderless

189
00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:19.820
Ship Guihai.

190
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:25.580
Were you hurt by this?

191
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.100
Gather the best men

192
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.980
and start patrolling Haifang
from tonight.

193
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.700
Provide extra protection
to Ship Guihai.

194
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.180
Yes.

195
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:39.100
(Ship Guihai will be robbed
at about 10:00 pm tonight.)

196
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:42.860
Mr. Huang sent a message

197
00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:44.940
that Shen Liancheng is going to
rob Ship Guihai.

198
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.620
Guihai Warrior is known for

199
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.700
his chivalrous acts.

200
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:50.940
If we let Shen Liancheng,

201
00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.420
the black sheep of our Tea Gang,

202
00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.820
rob his merchant ship,

203
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.460
when the word gets out,

204
00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.940
the Tea Gang is never gonna
regain its reputation.

205
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.060
We're being robbed!

206
00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:52.220
Go down!

207
00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:08.700
Who are you?

208
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.580
Look carefully before you hit!

209
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.100
You're the one I'm gonna hit!

210
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:13.580
Everybody, stop!

211
00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:16.460
Stop!

212
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.420
Take off your masks!

213
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:29.980
It's them!

214
00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:30.860
The three spies!

215
00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.060
Catch them!

216
00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:44.340
Miss.

217
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.540
Take your people and go. Hurry!

218
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:55.100
Ning Yuxuan is here.

219
00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:55.700
Let's go!

220
00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.860
Keep your heads up.

221
00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:44.980
You, in the back.

222
00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.460
Raise your head.

223
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.460
Raise your head.

224
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:56.580
Go.

225
00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.340
Mr. Li?

226
00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.580
Why are you here?

227
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.180
Mr. Ning.

228
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:10.580
Why is it you again?

229
00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:15.700
Gui Bai.

230
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.220
Go and bring Shen Liancheng here.

231
00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:20.980
Yes.

232
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:36.940
Take him away.

233
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:38.820
Go!

234
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:52.980
Your Lordship.

235
00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.420
Ning Yuxuan.

236
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:57.860
How dare you...

237
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:02.220
Shen Liancheng.

238
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.580
Since when did the Dragon Gang

239
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.460
start doing business with pirates

240
00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:07.100
and robbing merchant ships?

241
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.060
What pirates?

242
00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:10.420
You're slandering us

243
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.700
and taking personal revenge on us!

244
00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.100
Bring him here.

245
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:16.820
Go!

246
00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:18.700
Go!

247
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.180
Your subordinate, Li Ming,

248
00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.460
colluded with the pirate, Hu Da,

249
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.940
and robbed Ship Guihai.

250
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.220
Now there is both a witness
and material evidence!

251
00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.820
What else can you say?

252
00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.620
It was Li Ming who did it.

253
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.540
What does that have to do with me?

254
00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.220
This is the confession
the two of them wrote.

255
00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.860
How else can you justify yourself?

256
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.380
(Confession)

257
00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:58.820
Take him away.

258
00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.300
Ning Yuxuan, listen,

259
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.340
don't think you can do anything you want

260
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:02.620
in Haifang!

261
00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:08.940
Search the ship

262
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.980
in case someone got away.

263
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:25.860
There is no one here.

264
00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:27.100
Let's go to the next place.

265
00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:27.860
Yes.

266
00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.740
(Formula of Scar Recovering Cream
Ji Man)

267
00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.180
Formula of Scar Recovering Cream.

268
00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.460
Her Ladyship changed the name
of Reflection Pavilion

269
00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:01.700
to Feiwan Pavilion

270
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.700
and the name of Scar Recovering Cream

271
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:03.940
to Feiwan Face Cream.

272
00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.420
Scar Recovering Cream.

273
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.620
(Ji Man)

274
00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.540
Ji Man?

275
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.300
(Look, doesn't Mrs. Ning)

276
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.740
(look like Miss Ji?)

277
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:20.540
(Yeah?)

278
00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:22.660
(She does look like her.)

279
00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:23.860
(Right?)

280
00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.340
(I guess you are right.)

281
00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.180
Hurry up and see

282
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.100
if there is any other formula.

283
00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.540
Poria Cocos Old Turtle Soup.

284
00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.900
Old turtle...

285
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:45.100
Turtle.

286
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.420
(Tufuling Old Turtle Soup)

287
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.140
Turtle.

288
00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.100
(Stewed Eggs with Pigeon)

289
00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:54.860
Turtle.

290
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.460
(Tufuling Old Turtle Soup)

291
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:07.220
(Soft-shelled turtle)

292
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.540
Okay, done.

293
00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.580
I will move to the Reflection Pavilion.

294
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.900
But these profound and powerful words

295
00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.100
cannot be written

296
00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.500
without more than ten years of practice.

297
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:19.820
The handwriting

298
00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.820
looks a lot like Her Ladyship's.

299
00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.740
Could this be her room?

300
00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:36.660
So her name is...

301
00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.900
(Ji Man)

302
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.380
Ji Man.

303
00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:52.900
What's her relationship

304
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.900
with Guihai Warrior?

305
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.100
She is either his daughter

306
00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.620
or his wife.

307
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:03.860
Wife?

308
00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.900
Why hasn't Ning Yuxuan come yet?

309
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.020
I guess he isn't up yet.

310
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.500
He isn't up.

311
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.660
His Lordship is here.

312
00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.300
Why are you dressed in official clothes?

313
00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.340
I have something to say to Sangyu.

314
00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.100
Muxu, leave us.

315
00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.980
Why are you so secretive?
What do you want to say?

316
00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.420
You...

317
00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.380
I...

318
00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.140
No matter what you're gonna say,

319
00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:08.820
you should

320
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.100
come over and finish your food first,

321
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.140
or it'll get cold soon.

322
00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.340
I'll peel an egg for you.

323
00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:17.300
I...

324
00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.980
Your Lordship, you still have
official affairs to deal with.

325
00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:27.500
Yes.

326
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:30.340
Business is important.

327
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.100
You should eat first.

328
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.540
I'll

329
00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:37.780
talk to you later.

330
00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.740
Are you not eating?

331
00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.740
No.

332
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:44.060
What does he want to say?

333
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.140
Could it be...

334
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.980
(Does he want to confess his love to me?)

335
00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:02.740
No wonder he's too shy to say it.

336
00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:11.380
Be gentle.

337
00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:12.540
I know.

338
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:14.380
No.

339
00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.420
Don't worry, everyone.

340
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.740
If there is not enough medicine,

341
00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:17.380
I'll ask my brothers

342
00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:18.300
to bring some more.

343
00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:18.900
Okay.

344
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.060
You have suffered.

345
00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:20.900
When we get back,

346
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:21.620
I'll treat you all to a good drink

347
00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:22.500
and make sure you're well taken care of.

348
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.180
Okay.

349
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:24.980
Ouch!

350
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:26.580
I know.

351
00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.660
Even a little injury
could make you scream.

352
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.580
Are you feeling better?

353
00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.580
Much better.

354
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.100
Okay.

355
00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:36.420
I know.

356
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:37.820
Guys.

357
00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:38.980
Don't worry.

358
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.340
Your Ship Guihai

359
00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:41.780
has been rescued by Ning Yuxuan,

360
00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.020
the newly appointed magistrate.

361
00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:45.380
That's great.

362
00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.340
Sir.

363
00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:47.180
Are we

364
00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.580
able to go home soon?

365
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:49.820
By the way,

366
00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:51.860
who is Ning Yuxuan?

367
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.540
I must thank him in person.

368
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.420
Yes, we must thank him.

369
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.500
We must thank him.

370
00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.380
What are you talking about?

371
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.580
What nonsense are you talking about?

372
00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:58.340
The person who saved our lives

373
00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.380
is right here with us.

374
00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.100
If it weren't for Mr. Yuan today,

375
00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:01.780
none of us

376
00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.100
would be alive now!

377
00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.060
Say thank you to Mr. Yuan now.

378
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:06.420
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

379
00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.260
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

380
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:07.980
Thank you.

381
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:08.820
Thank you, Mr. Yuan.

382
00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:09.980
Go ahead.

383
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:11.740
Go away.

384
00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.860
They all listen to you.

385
00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:17.740
Are you the owner of Ship Guihai?

386
00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:18.740
No.

387
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:20.260
I'm not the owner of Ship Guihai.

388
00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.180
Our master and lady

389
00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:22.860
are the owners.

390
00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.100
It's just

391
00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.100
that they went to the capital

392
00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.780
and I don't know where they are.

393
00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.620
I'm still waiting for them.

394
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:34.900
I've long heard of

395
00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.060
Guihai Warrior's great reputation.

396
00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:36.980
When he returns to Haifang,

397
00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:38.260
I'll come and visit him in person.

398
00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.060
Mr. Yuan.

399
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.100
When our lady comes back,

400
00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:46.740
you must meet her.

401
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.660
I'm sure she will like someone

402
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.020
as magnanimous as you.

403
00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.420
Well?

404
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.140
Are you trying

405
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:56.380
to set them up?

406
00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.500
It's not impossible.

407
00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.300
Let me tell you something,

408
00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.060
our lady and Mr. Yuan

409
00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:04.540
are perfect for each other.

410
00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.820
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

411
00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:17.740
What?

412
00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:19.180
I can't believe you went through

413
00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:20.580
something so dangerous that day.

414
00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.860
I told Gui Bai

415
00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.340
to stay for the night before leaving,

416
00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.740
but he had to leave that night.

417
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.860
He doesn't

418
00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:32.500
care about his own health.

419
00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:34.540
But I saw him

420
00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.740
this morning.

421
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.060
He seemed

422
00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:38.780
fine.

423
00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:39.660
Really?

424
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:42.780
That's good.

425
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.180
I'll ask him again later.

426
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:46.900
Don't worry.

427
00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:49.900
Also,

428
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.660
I'm here today for one more thing.

429
00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.980
I want to thank you.

430
00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.380
You helped us

431
00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:57.300
expose Joy Cosmetics' poor quality

432
00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.100
face cream.

433
00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:00.820
Otherwise, my sisters and I

434
00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:02.340
would have suffered a lot.

435
00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:04.780
And by the way,

436
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.780
we've all used

437
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:08.500
the Feiwan Face Cream
you gave me last time.

438
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:11.340
You have?

439
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:13.300
How do you like it?

440
00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:15.820
What do you think?

441
00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:18.780
I think...

442
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.740
It worked really well.

443
00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.140
We think

444
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:22.860
it's the best face cream

445
00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.100
we've ever used.

446
00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:25.580
They all want it.

447
00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.780
It's great.

448
00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:27.900
If they need more,

449
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:28.900
just let me know,

450
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.900
and I'll make regular deliveries
to Shuiyan House.

451
00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.060
Thank you, Ms. Nie.

452
00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:35.340
Ms. Nie.

453
00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:36.860
Since your face cream

454
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.540
is so good,

455
00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.100
your business at Haoxue Cosmetics

456
00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.260
must be really good, right?

457
00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.900
It's okay.

458
00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:50.260
Well,

459
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:53.300
I just opened my shop here in Haifang

460
00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.620
and I don't have many acquaintances here.

461
00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.100
Maybe the locals

462
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:57.420
still don't know

463
00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.860
about my shop.

464
00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.580
Ms. Nie.

465
00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:11.340
I don't know

466
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:12.340
how to help you,

467
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:13.420
but

468
00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:15.300
I've been in Haifang for years

469
00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.820
and have some followers.

470
00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.180
If there is anything

471
00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.260
you need from me,

472
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.420
just let me know.

473
00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.340
Miss Shui, you are so kind.

474
00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:30.580
Miss Shui.

475
00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:32.540
Have you ever thought about

476
00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.020
using your reputation to earn money?

477
00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:38.300
I use Haoxue Cosmetics' products

478
00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:39.420
because I think they're good

479
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.020
and I sincerely recommend them.

480
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.340
I don't need to be paid.

481
00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:43.820
No way.

482
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.260
If you don't want to be paid,

483
00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:46.820
how can I dare to ask for your help?

484
00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:48.620
And it just occurred to me

485
00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:50.180
that there are indeed many things

486
00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.580
I can trouble you with.

487
00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:52.140
For example,

488
00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.100
you need to work with the artist
to draw a portrait of you.

489
00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.020
You need to come to

490
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.420
Haoxue Cosmetics every day

491
00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:58.380
to try out new products,

492
00:25:58.580 --> 00:25:59.260
and you also need to

493
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.300
tell me how you feel

494
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.100
about the new products.

495
00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.060
In fact, Shuiyan House

496
00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.860
and Haoxue Cosmetics can also...

497
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.300
There is no need to rush.

498
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.780
You can go back and think about it

499
00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.860
before you answer me.

500
00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:20.300
No need.

501
00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.100
I'm willing to do it.

502
00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:25.260
You...

503
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:27.740
You agreed?

504
00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:31.860
I have never heard of

505
00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.620
these things before,

506
00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.580
but I trust you.

507
00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:37.820
That's great.

508
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.140
With your help,

509
00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.500
I won't have to

510
00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.060
worry about Haoxue Cosmetics' business.

511
00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:45.180
Ms. Nie.

512
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.540
There's one more thing

513
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:47.740
I want to tell you.

514
00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.180
What is it?

515
00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:53.340
You look beautiful

516
00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:54.420
in women's clothes.

517
00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.660
I'm still no match for you.

518
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:29.340
It's done.

519
00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:30.540
It's done?

520
00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:31.980
You've finished

521
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:32.980
all the official duties today.

522
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:33.820
But...

523
00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:35.380
This is...

524
00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.900
There must be something else I can do.

525
00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:44.620
Let's go and interrogate
Shen Liancheng again.

526
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.180
Shen Liancheng was
interrogated yesterday.

527
00:27:58.340 --> 00:27:59.390
Your Lordship, do you feel

528
00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:00.420
terribly upset?

529
00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.540
It's bothering you.

530
00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:15.980
Yeah.

531
00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.260
You're right.

532
00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:23.300
I'm going to tell her

533
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.100
that her real name is Ji Man.

534
00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.060
Have you really decided?

535
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.060
I shouldn't keep it from her

536
00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:33.420
whether it will turn out
to be good or bad.

537
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:36.980
I'll leave it to fate.

538
00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:37.980
Your Lordship.

539
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:40.900
You only need to tell Her Ladyship

540
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.180
who she is.

541
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:44.260
Why are you so nervous?

542
00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.740
She doesn't bite.

543
00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.020
I'm...

544
00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:56.740
Never mind.

545
00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.020
I can't explain it to you.

546
00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.980
Anyway, I must

547
00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.580
tell her this time.

548
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:07.780
Where's your boss?

549
00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:08.900
She is inside.

550
00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:11.340
Inside?

551
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.780
Do you want to listen?

552
00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.420
Sangyu.

553
00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:00.980
I have something to tell you.

554
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:02.340
I know

555
00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.860
you'll be angry when you know it.

556
00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:05.020
I also know

557
00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:06.140
I'm not doing it right,

558
00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:09.740
but I can't hide it from you anymore.

559
00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:13.860
On the way to Haifang,

560
00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.900
I knew you weren't Nie Sangyu.

561
00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.660
Only in recent days did I find out

562
00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.020
that you're the daughter of Guihai Warrior,

563
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:29.380
and your name is Ji Man.

564
00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.620
I guessed you'd be surprised.

565
00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:40.580
I was surprised, too.

566
00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.020
But at that time,
there were so many doubts

567
00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:45.020
that I couldn't tell you.

568
00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:46.100
I wasn't sure

569
00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.380
if you really lost your memory,

570
00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:49.820
and I was wondering

571
00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.100
why you approached me

572
00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:54.760
and why you became

573
00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:56.060
Nie Sangyu all of a sudden,

574
00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:58.300
and if there was

575
00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.340
any kind of conspiracy.

576
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.540
I've racked my brain
over these past few days,

577
00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.380
and I still couldn't figure it out.

578
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:10.100
But I have figured out one thing,

579
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:17.140
which is I like you.

580
00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:18.420
I think about you

581
00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.740
before I go to bed,

582
00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.740
and I dream about you every night.

583
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.380
I've never felt this way

584
00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.740
about anyone before.

585
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.660
This is the first time in over twenty years

586
00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:31.980
that I've wanted

587
00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:33.580
to be with someone

588
00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:34.820
so badly.

589
00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:39.300
And that person

590
00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:45.580
is you.

591
00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:00.620
Sang...

592
00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:04.020
Ji Man.

593
00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.540
I've

594
00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:09.660
summoned all my courage

595
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.100
to tell you that.

596
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.340
Whether you will be mad at me

597
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:17.340
or disgusted with me,

598
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.740
I just want to tell you

599
00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:33.900
that I like you.

600
00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.340
Why are you here?

601
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.540
Your Lordship, I didn't hear anything!

602
00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:40.300
I didn't hear anything.

603
00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.260
- I didn't hear anything.
- No.

604
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:42.900
- I didn't hear anything.
- No.

605
00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:44.740
I didn't hear it.

606
00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:47.820
If you dare

607
00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:48.820
to tell anyone

608
00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.780
what I just said, I'll...

609
00:32:58.500 --> 00:32:59.420
I didn't see it. I didn't hear it.

610
00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:00.860
I didn't see it.

611
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:01.660
Where's Sangyu?

612
00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:04.500
Her Ladyship went to
buy some raw materials.

613
00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.100
Your Ladyship?

614
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.060
Gui Bai?

615
00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:22.620
His Lordship...

616
00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.060
What are you doing here?

617
00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.060
What are you...

618
00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.900
What are you doing here?

619
00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:40.500
I'm...

620
00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.580
I'm just here to see

621
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:45.660
if there is anything I can help with.

622
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:46.580
Since everything seems to be going well,

623
00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.540
I'll just leave.

624
00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.420
Do you have something to tell me?

625
00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.100
All right.

626
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.620
It's just the two of us now.

627
00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.060
If you have something to say,

628
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.380
just say it.

629
00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:11.900
I...

630
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:12.580
In fact, I already knew

631
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:13.580
what you wanted to say last time

632
00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.260
when we were at the mansion.

633
00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:16.900
- I don't have anything to tell you.
- I think...

634
00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:17.780
You do.

635
00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:20.300
You do.

636
00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:21.900
I don't!

637
00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:26.300
You...

638
00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:32.300
It must be because he's shy.

639
00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:40.780
Silly.

640
00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.700
I'll see how long you can hold it in.

641
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:53.300
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

642
00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.700
Here, this is yours.

643
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.780
Please pay the bill over there.

644
00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:57.100
All right, next one.

645
00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:58.060
Who else?

646
00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:58.900
- Come often.
- Thank you.

647
00:34:58.900 --> 00:34:59.380
Me!

648
00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.020
Me, too!

649
00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:00.940
Do you have any more
of the Feiwan Face Cream?

650
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:01.620
I'll have two more.

651
00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:03.300
There are still three bottles left.

652
00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.620
You can take them all.

653
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.220
It'll take half a month
for the next batch to arrive.

654
00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:07.380
Ms. Nie, which product

655
00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:08.580
is Miss Shui using?

656
00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.100
Miss Shui is using

657
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.460
(Feiwan Face Cream)
the moisturizing cream.

658
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:12.620
Miss, I think your skin

659
00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.660
is moist enough.

660
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:14.540
Why don't you

661
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:15.980
try this one?

662
00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:17.460
This one will

663
00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:18.580
make your skin fairer.

664
00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:19.060
I'll take them all.

665
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:20.220
We'll take them all.

666
00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.140
Okay.

667
00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.380
I'll pack them up for you.

668
00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.540
Do you have any more
of the Feiwan Face Cream?

669
00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:24.660
Sorry, Miss.

670
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:25.540
The last three bottles

671
00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:26.460
have been bought

672
00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:27.100
by these two girls.

673
00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.780
Do you have any more
of the recommended Rejuvenating Toner?

674
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:29.940
The Rejuvenating Toner.

675
00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:30.420
Muxu.

676
00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.060
See if there is any more

677
00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:31.860
of the Rejuvenating Toner.

678
00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.300
You can take them all.

679
00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.260
(Rejuvenating Toner)
This is the only bottle left.

680
00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.220
There's one more bottle.

681
00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:35.060
I'll take it!

682
00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:35.900
Okay, okay.

683
00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.260
When will the next batch arrive?

684
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:38.740
The next batch might...

685
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.100
Can we pre-order?

686
00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.580
Sure.

687
00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:42.140
By the way,

688
00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.460
- for those who want to pre-order,
- Okay.

689
00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:43.780
please leave

690
00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.100
your deposit and address

691
00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:45.740
here,

692
00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.660
and we will deliver it

693

to your residence

694
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:48.700
when the next batch arrives.

695
00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.500
Okay?

696
00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:50.300
- Okay.
- Great.

697
00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:51.420
I'd like to

698
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:52.420
reiterate here

699
00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.300
that all the products launched
by Haoxue Cosmetics Shop

700
00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.060
will be personally used by Miss Shui,

701
00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.100
and her favorite products

702
00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.100
will be recommended to everyone.

703
00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:58.660
Okay?

704
00:35:58.780 --> 00:35:59.060
- Good.
- Okay.

705
00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.300
You can rest assured to use them.

706
00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:01.140
Rest assured to use them.

707
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:01.980
We hope that you can

708
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.460
share your experiences with us

709
00:36:03.580 --> 00:36:05.260
at any time. Okay?

710
00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:06.020
Okay.

711
00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:07.100
Those who need to make reservations,
please follow me.

712
00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.020
This way, please.

713
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.460
This way, please.

714
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:10.660
Thank you.

715
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.020
This way.

716
00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:14.780
Thank you.

717
00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.060
Take care. Thank you.

718
00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:22.380
The products are all sold out.

719
00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:25.140
That's impressive.

720
00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.140
They sold out so quickly.

721
00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.580
That's because you're good.

722
00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:29.100
Look.

723
00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:29.740
Those girls

724
00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:30.780
came for you.

725
00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:31.740
The 50 bottles of Feiwan Face Cream

726
00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.220
have all sold out,

727
00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:34.220
and many customers

728
00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:34.940
want to pre-order.

729
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:35.900
They are queuing up over there.

730
00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:37.580
I'm afraid

731
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.700
we won't be able to afford to have you.

732
00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.620
Don't say that.

733
00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:43.540
If there is anything

734
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:44.540
I can help you with,

735
00:36:44.740 --> 00:36:45.900
I will do my best.

736
00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:47.580
I'll give you

737
00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:48.780
your share of the profits later.

738
00:36:48.980 --> 00:36:49.580
No.

739
00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:51.900
I told you

740
00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.300
I won't take any money.

741
00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:54.620
I recommend these products

742
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.260
because I think they are good.

743
00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:57.180
No way.

744
00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:59.060
Even sisters keep clear accounts.

745
00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:02.940
All right.

746
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.580
How about this,

747
00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:05.660
if anyone

748
00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.580
from Shuiyan House

749
00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:08.420
comes to buy something from you,

750
00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:09.980
you can give them a half-price discount.

751
00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.100
No problem. It's a deal.

752
00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.940
By the way, what about Gui Bai?

753
00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:17.420
Is he getting better?

754
00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:18.900
Gui Bai?

755
00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.260
He should be almost recovered.

756
00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:23.100
If you're worried about him,

757
00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:23.780
I'll take you to see him

758
00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:24.460
later.

759
00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:25.540
No need.

760
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.300
I just want to know

761
00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:28.580
if he has fully recovered.

762
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.180
After all,

763
00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.740
he got injured because of me.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.420
Miss.

766
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.660
I still worry about you.

767
00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:42.580
I also want to take you with me,

768
00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.100
but Haifang

769
00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:45.740
is not like the capital.

770
00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:47.980
You should stay here

771
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.100
and look after the house.

772
00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.140
Take good care of yourself.

773
00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.580
Miss.

774
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.860
You must stay safe on the road.

775
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.580
Tao.

776
00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:09.780
General Tao.

777
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.500
Yixian, Qingyun.

778
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.380
What are you doing here?

779
00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.460
I knew you'd be here.

780
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.540
I don't have time

781
00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:18.020
to drink with you.

782
00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:18.980
I'm going...

783
00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.580
I knew it.

784
00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:22.940
I heard that His Majesty

785
00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.220
approved your transfer to Haifang

786
00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.740
at the imperial court yesterday.

787
00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.220
You're well-informed.

788
00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.060
Why don't we go together?

789
00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:33.540
What do you mean?

790
00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.180
Are you also going to Haifang?

791
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.460
I want to see my sister.

792
00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:40.220
I've heard that the people
in Haifang are tough,

793
00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:41.140
and the girls there

794
00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.580
are different from those in the capital.

795
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:43.780
I've had nothing to do lately.

796
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:44.700
I'd like to take a look there.

797
00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.060
I've packed my luggage.

798
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:47.740
General Tao, let's go.

799
00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:50.660
Big Mouth.

800
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:51.980
Are you going to Haifang, too?

801
00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:53.900
Why can't I go?

802
00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:55.940
Are you going, too?

803
00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:57.180
Yeah.

804
00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.780
I don't want to go with you.

805
00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.060
Do you think I want to go with you?

806
00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.300
Traveling with you is like

807
00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.780
bringing a cage of chickens and ducks.

808
00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.380
Qin Yixian.

809
00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.580
You'd better be polite to me,

810
00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:07.740
otherwise, when we arrive in Haifang,

811
00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:08.700
I will tell

812
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:09.380
all the girls

813
00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:10.300
about your romantic stories.

814
00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.100
Big Mouth.

815
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:11.980
Don't talk nonsense!

816
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:12.540
Qin Yixian.

817
00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:13.780
Shut your mouth!

818
00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.500
All right, stop it.

819
00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.620
It's getting lively now.

820
00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:18.540
Let's go.

821
00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.620
Qingyun.

822
00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.900
Let's take the carriage.

823
00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:22.900
Okay.

824
00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:36.940
Ning Yuxuan, I'm telling you,

825
00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.300
I won't say anything

826
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.300
no matter how many times
you interrogate me.

827
00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:40.980
I'm not here to interrogate you.

828
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.460
I'm here to tell you something.

829
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:47.020
The Dragon Gang has had 39 members

830
00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.380
arrested for murder and robbery.

831
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.420
Their businesses

832
00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:51.980
got suspended

833
00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:52.900
for involving fraudulent activities

834
00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:54.220
and not paying taxes.

835
00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.420
Including Mingyue Restaurant

836
00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.620
which was closed

837
00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:58.580
for serving rotten food

838
00:39:58.700 --> 00:39:59.900
to diners.

839
00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.660
Qingyue Restaurant was also reported

840
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:02.660
for watering down the wine

841
00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.100
and was also closed.

842
00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.740
You evil official, you...

843
00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.420
You are using your power
for personal revenge!

844
00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.540
Without these illegal businesses,

845
00:40:10.220 --> 00:40:11.020
I'd like to see

846
00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.260
if your master

847
00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.380
can still sit still.

848
00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:37.940
Mr. Ling.

849
00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.220
How did it go?

850
00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:41.660
As you expected,

851
00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.380
Wen Wan has left for Haifang.

852
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.380
Ning Yuxuan.

853
00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:49.740
Your two wives

854
00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.380
are a real pain.

855
00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.100
Wen Wan's departure to Haifang

856
00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.580
is actually good for you.

857
00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.380
We'll just sit back and watch.

858
00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.260
Zheng.

859
00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.620
I need you to go to Haifang immediately

860
00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.740
and keep a close eye on Wen Wan.

861
00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.980
Once she starts to take action,

862
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.540
let's just set another fire to

863
00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.940
Ning Yuxuan's backyard.

864
00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:16.460
Yes.

865
00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.900
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

866
00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.380
- This one is particularly moisturizing.
- Here.

867
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:37.740
Try this one.

868
00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:38.980
How does it feel?

869
00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:39.740
Can I try it?

870
00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.100
Take care. Come again.

871
00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.620
Here, we also have this one,

872
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:43.700
which is also good.

873
00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:44.700
I recommend it to you.

874
00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:46.940
It's beautiful!

875
00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.020
Qingyun.

876
00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.180
Sangyu.

877
00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.500
When did you come?

878
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:52.580
Did you make all this?

879
00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:53.980
Miss Xue.

880
00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:55.500
Why are you all here?

881
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.460
As soon as I received your letter,

882
00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:58.300
I told General Tao

883
00:41:58.540 --> 00:41:59.100
that I would come here with him.

884
00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:00.620
I didn't expect

885
00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:01.860
Qingyun to be here.

886
00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:08.100
Qin Yixian is also here.

887
00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:09.500
Big Mouth.

888
00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:10.580
On this journey

889
00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:11.700
Miss Qingyun and General Tao

890
00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:12.980
had a good time talking along the way.

891
00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:13.900
If I didn't chat with you

892
00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:14.940
for fun,

893
00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.100
how bored would you have been?

894
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.580
Thank you.

895
00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:19.540
Sangyu.

896
00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:20.500
Well,

897
00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:21.900
how are you doing

898
00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:22.660
in Haifang these days?

899
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.260
I'm doing great.

900
00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.100
Look, I couldn't fulfill my dream

901
00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:24.900
in the capital,

902
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:25.940
but I made it happen here.

903
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.660
The Haoxue Cosmetics Shop
has finally opened.

904
00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:28.580
Your Ladyship.

905
00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.460
Although you mentioned it

906
00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:30.420
in your letter,

907
00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.180
seeing the Haoxue Cosmetics Shop

908
00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:32.020
in real life

909
00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.900
still surprised me.

910
00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:36.100
The cosmetics shops in the capital

911
00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.100
are not that different.

912
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:38.060
Of course.

913
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:38.740
That's why

914
00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.700
I asked you to do business with me.

915
00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:41.660
Isn't it great?

916
00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:43.180
I should have come earlier.

917
00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.500
It's not too late now.

918
00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:46.460
I will

919
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.540
show you around later,

920
00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.260
and you can take whatever you like.

921
00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:50.180
Really?

922
00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:51.860
Sangyu.

923
00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:53.580
You're awesome.

924
00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:54.900
I never knew

925
00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.500
you were interested in pharmacology,

926
00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:57.780
but now

927
00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:59.260
you've opened

928
00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:00.180
such a big shop.

929
00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:01.860
Sangyu is ingenious and clever.

930
00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.180
She can do anything she wants.

931
00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:05.460
When you

932
00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.580
have time,

933
00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:08.380
you can come here for tea and chat.

934
00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:09.420
- No problem.
- No problem.

935
00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:12.300
Ms. Nie.

936
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:13.980
If you need help here,

937
00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:14.980
I can lend a hand.

938
00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:16.500
Okay.

939
00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.660
Mr. Qin will never let go of any chance

940
00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:20.940
to deal with girls.

941
00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:21.620
Of course.

942
00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:22.940
All the girls in the world

943
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:24.220
are my good friends.

944
00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.100
Well,

945
00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.140
except for you.

946
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.180
Take a look around.

947
00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.180
Go ahead and look around.

948
00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.140
Sangyu.

949
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:35.980
General Tao.

950
00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:37.020
Let's look around.

951
00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:37.900
Give me a moment.

952
00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:39.300
- Sangyu, I...
- Let's go.

953
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.180
Sang...

954
00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.380
Come on. Let's look around.

955
00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.300
Look, Miss Xue.

956
00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.660
I designed all this.

957
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:45.580
It's so beautiful.

958
00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:46.420
Right?

959
00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:47.260
Since you've just arrived,

960
00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:48.180
you should get some rest first.

961
00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:48.980
In a few days,

962
00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:49.620
I'll take you

963
00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:50.660
to the market in Haifang.

964
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:51.620
There are a lot of

965
00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:52.300
interesting things there.

966
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.460
Really, Sangyu?

967
00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.660
Take me there soon.

968
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.020
I can't wait.

969
00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:57.420
By the way, Miss Xue,

970
00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.220
your room

971
00:43:58.420 --> 00:43:59.660
hasn't been cleaned yet.

972
00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:00.580
We can share a room.

973
00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:01.460
Okay.

974
00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.300
Miss Wen?

975
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.580
