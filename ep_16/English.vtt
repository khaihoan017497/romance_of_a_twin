3
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.100
(Jiangzhen Pavilion)

4
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.320
Sangyu.

5
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:09.370
I thought that...

6
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.290
I thought they would forget

7
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.480
the title of She-devil

8
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.530
after I left the capital,

9
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.530
and I could start over.

10
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.690
But Lianxiang is right.

11
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.720
Those I hurt

12
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.760
will never forget

13
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.640
how I hurt them.

14
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.160
They will never forget

15
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.810
the mistakes I made.

16
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.880
It's not your fault.

17
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.410
Whose fault is that then?

18
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.440
In fact...

19
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.880
I don't need comfort,

20
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.530
because I don't deserve it.

21
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.200
I...

22
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.200
I have something to tell you.

23
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.690
I am begging you.

24
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.480
Could you

25
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640
leave me alone?

26
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.320
Okay.

27
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.690
Thank you.

28
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.250
Sangyu.

29
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.690
What's up?

30
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.690
Qingyun.

31
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:15.850
What's wrong with your foot?

32
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.840
I...

33
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.720
I am fine.

34
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.050
I sprained my ankle on the way.

35
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.080
Where is my sister?

36
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.170
Sangyu.

37
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.320
Be careful.

38
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.200
Brother-in-law.

39
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.130
Where is my sister?

40
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.810
What happened today?

41
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:48.490
Yuxuan.

42
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.250
How is Her Ladyship now?

43
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.520
Ning Yuxuan, say something.

44
00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.250
How is she now?

45
00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.010
It's all my fault.

46
00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.760
I couldn't go to the trade fair

47
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.280
after I sprained my ankle.

48
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.370
Or they wouldn't be able to

49
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:03.760
bully my sister.

50
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.050
I'm going to see her.

51
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.520
Don't go.

52
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.350
She said

53
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.690
she wanted to be alone for a while.

54
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.570
- But...
- Qingyun.

55
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.880
Come and take a seat.

56
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.010
Yuxuan.

57
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.320
Don't you think something is wrong?

58
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.010
What happened to Lianxiang...

59
00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.440
How could it be such a coincidence?

60
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.810
What do you mean?

61
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.840
Three years ago,

62
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.640
we gave Lianxiang

63
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.370
a hundred taels
to let her leave the Mansion.

64
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.010
But why did she say

65
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.690
she was sold to a brothel?

66
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.760
Why do you remember it
so clearly?

67
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.080
I have been in charge of the accounts
of the Marquis's Mansion.

68
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.370
I have an impression of this.

69
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.490
So what happened tonight
was no coincidence.

70
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.690
Someone ordered her to come back?

71
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.400
Of course she was ordered.

72
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.880
Here, take some water.

73
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.440
This is where you live

74
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.880
from now on.

75
00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:05.490
I'll live next door to you.

76
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.370
Miss Shui.

77
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.400
You are so nice to me.

78
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.250
Will you blame me

79
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.760
for my gaffe today?

80
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.640
I didn't expect

81
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.760
Nie Sangyu

82
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.370
to be so vicious.

83
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:26.610
But don't worry.

84
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.610
I will be on your side.

85
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.730
If you

86
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.810
had told me

87
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.400
these things earlier,

88
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.440
how could you have suffered?

89
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.840
But Miss Shui, I was afraid.

90
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.520
I was even more frightened

91
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:42.640
when I saw her.

92
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.080
As soon as I close my eyes,

93
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.050
I can see her beating me

94
00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.200
with a whip in my mind,

95
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.960
injuring me so badly.

96
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.730
She is the general's daughter

97
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.490
and the marquis's wife,

98
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.050
but I am just

99
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.810
an orphan.

100
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.490
I am worse than

101
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.400
an ant to her.

102
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.960
I brought shame on her

103
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.250
on impulse this time.

104
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.960
She will never let me go.

105
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.010
So what if she is noble?

106
00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.770
We are no longer the weak girls

107
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.240
who let others bully us.

108
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.320
Lianxiang, remember.

109
00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.280
You are now a member
of Shuiyan House.

110
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.520
I will be responsible to you.

111
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:21.440
I will do my best

112
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.320
to protect you.

113
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.960
Trust me, okay?

114
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.730
Miss Shui.

115
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.400
Thank you.

116
00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.050
Take a good rest.

117
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.490
Stop crying.

118
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:46.400
Your Lordship.

119
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:47.690
How is Sangyu?

120
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.080
She still doesn't eat or drink,

121
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.080
and is shutting herself in the room,

122
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.080
not letting others in.

123
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.250
It's my fault.

124
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:01.400
I shouldn't have hidden it from her.

125
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.050
Otherwise, she wouldn't be in such pain.

126
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:06.760
Your Lordship.

127
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:10.010
Your Lordship.Your Lordship.

128
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.170
Haoxue Cosmetics has been smashed.

129
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:11.930
Her Ladyship rushed out

130
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.810
after hearing the news.

131
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:13.250
What?

132
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.570
Why didn't you stop her?

133
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.280
I...

134
00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:15.960
Your...

135
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.330
Stop it.

136
00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.210
How did your hand get hurt?

137
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.400
Stop it.

138
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.330
Stop it.

139
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.850
Do you remember

140
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.040
when it

141
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.640
first opened?

142
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.880
At that time, I really thought

143
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.010
my dream had come true.

144
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.920
Now it's all gone.

145
00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:42.640
Tell me.

146
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.850
How can I be so vicious?

147
00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.370
How many bad things have I done?

148
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.160
How many bad things have I done

149
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.620
that I don't know yet?

150
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.490
It's not your fault.

151
00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.160
The She-devil left the capital,

152
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:25.450
and is still a She-devil

153
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:27.210
after being chased to Haifang.

154
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:37.520
I can't get rid of it.

155
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.040
No matter where I am,

156
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.680
no matter what I do,

157
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.850
no one will believe me.

158
00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.850
No one will believe me.

159
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:15.850
None of this is your fault.

160
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.920
It's Nie Sangyu's fault.

161
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.850
It's Nie Sangyu.

162
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.210
Although you look exactly

163
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.370
the same as Nie Sangyu,

164
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.370
you two have
very different personalities,

165
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:34.520
and are not the same person at all.

166
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.610
The real Nie Sangyu

167
00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:37.610
has the imprint of plum blossoms
on her shoulder,

168
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:38.880
but you don't.

169
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.280
(I don't care if you're playing the fool)

170
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.560
(Reflection Pavilion)
(or you've really lost your memory.)

171
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.090
(What's done is done.)

172
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.330
You can't deny it.

173
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.640
(Couldn't I do this before?)

174
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.640
No.

175
00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.400
Did I know how to cook before?

176
00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.250
You didn't even know

177
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:58.040
where the kitchen is.

178
00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.330
(Let me go.)

179
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.970
Let me go.

180
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.010
I've told you

181
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:05.800
many times that

182
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.920
we're not a perfect match.

183
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.560
Stop forcing me, okay?

184
00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.040
Then why did you

185
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.130
try so hard

186
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:12.560
to marry me before?

187
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.680
(So did something else)

188
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.640
(pop out)

189
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.610
(of your mind?)

190
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.250
Something else?

191
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:18.330
For example,

192
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:20.490
memories from the past.

193
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.330
(Haoxue Cosmetics Shop
is opening now.)

194
00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:24.520
(Ms. Nie,)

195
00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.130
(may your shop prosper
in the years to come,)

196
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:28.250
(and may it get you lots of fortune.)

197
00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.610
(Wishing you prosperity
and all the best.)

198
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.760
(Those I hurt)

199
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.250
(will never forget)

200
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.760
(how I hurt them.)

201
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.560
They will never forget

202
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.370
the mistakes I made.

203
00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:42.370
It's not your fault.

204
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:43.880
Whose fault is that then?

205
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.800
I... I am not Nie Sangyu?

206
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.800
Then who am I?

207
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:14.210
Your name is Ji Man,

208
00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:17.490
and you should be the daughter
of Guihai Warrior.

209
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:18.330
How do you know?

210
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:19.920
At that time, Shen Liancheng
robbed Ship Guihai.

211
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.010
I found a formula

212
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:21.680
(for Scar Recovering Cream)

213
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.880
(signed by Ji Man on the boat,)

214
00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:24.680
(Formula for Scar Recovering Cream)
(which is exactly the same as yours.)

215
00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:26.680
(Wang Ba)
(And the connected words)

216
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.490
are the same as the ones
you gave me back then.

217
00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:30.730
It must be you.

218
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.880
You are not Nie Sangyu.

219
00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.490
You are Ji Man.

220
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.920
That's to say...

221
00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:58.640
That's to say,

222
00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.210
I'm really not Nie Sangyu.

223
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:09.160
So

224
00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:11.400
none of these bad things
were done by me.

225
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:13.880
And

226
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.330
I didn't hurt those people,

227
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:16.210
did I?

228
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:20.010
You didn't.

229
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:21.400
Am I really not Nie Sangyu?

230
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:21.970
You are not Nie Sangyu.

231
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:22.920
I'm not Nie Sangyu.

232
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.010
You are not Nie Sangyu.

233
00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.800
I'm going to tell them.

234
00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:27.970
I am going to tell everyone

235
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:29.680
that I am not Nie Sangyu.

236
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.450
When did you know this?

237
00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:39.450
I...

238
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:42.800
Back then, there were many doubts,

239
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:43.610
and I finally

240
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:44.520
confirmed it

241
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.250
after several investigations.

242
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.160
I...

243
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.490
So you knew this

244
00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:54.370
when the fair was held?

245
00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:55.130
I was going to

246
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.280
tell you later, but...

247
00:14:58.450 --> 00:14:59.130
It's my fault.

248
00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.090
None of this would have happened

249
00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:01.560
if I had told you earlier.

250
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.680
I am willing to make it up.

251
00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.010
How can you make it up?

252
00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.160
Since you knew that

253
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.490
I am not Nie Sangyu long ago,

254
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.370
why didn't you tell me earlier?

255
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:18.090
Everyone thinks

256
00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.760
I'm the one who did the bad thing.

257
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.760
No one will believe that I am not her.

258
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.610
No one will believe that

259
00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.610
I didn't do any of them.

260
00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:32.850
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

261
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.480
If I could justify myself,

262
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.730
my Haoxue Cosmetics
wouldn't have been smashed.

263
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:43.920
Tell me how to make it up.

264
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.400
I...

265
00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.010
Leave.

266
00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.730
I don't want to see you.

267
00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.160
Ji Man.

268
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.610
Leave!

269
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.760
Leave!

270
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:17.880
Okay.

You idiot.

289
00:18:04.930 --> 00:18:06.730
You screwed things up
over and over again.

290
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:07.690
Not only was the tax money lost,

291
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.120
but the Dragon Gang
was about to disperse.

292
00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.320
Are you trying to

293
00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.120
court death?

294
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:16.970
My bad.

295
00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.280
But Ning Yuxuan

296
00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:19.560
is indeed powerful.

297
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.840
Thank you for your rescue, sir.

298
00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.490
Please give me another chance.

299
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:28.800
I will kill Ning Yuxuan myself.

300
00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:34.930
Okay.

301
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.120
I will give you another chance.

302
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:48.040
(Everyone thinks)

303
00:18:48.730 --> 00:18:50.650
(I'm the one who did the bad thing.)

304
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:53.930
(No one will believe that I am not her.)

305
00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.490
(No one will believe that.)

306
00:18:57.010 --> 00:18:59.930
(Haoxue Cosmetics shouldn't
have been smashed.)

307
00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.080
(Tell me how to make it up.)

308
00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:16.280
Your Lordship.

309
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:20.490
We got the news that

310
00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:23.120
Shen Liancheng disappeared

311
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.210
after being taken away
by mysterious men.

312
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:28.800
I see.

313
00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.840
Over the past few days,

314
00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:10.970
your chess skills

315
00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.930
have improved a lot.

316
00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:16.410
I am flattered.

317
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.800
I'm just a student

318
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.690
compared to you.

319
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.840
I heard that

320
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.080
Ning Yuxuan is living

321
00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.320
a happy life in Haifang.

322
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.840
The way to play chess is

323
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.560
to command the overall situation.

324
00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.010
Take the butterfly effect
into consideration.

325
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.490
Avoid ignoring details

326
00:20:55.170 --> 00:20:57.040
and being taken advantage of.

327
00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:06.930
What's your

328
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.600
next step?

329
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.280
Things are like chess.

330
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:30.600
Turning the tide
lies in this crucial step.

331
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:37.040
A risky move breaks the game.

332
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:40.360
Looks like you've

333
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:43.250
planned and prepared the game.

334
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.840
In my opinion,

335
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.010
the game

336
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.280
has just started.

337
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.320
Your Lordship.

338
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:25.840
A murder case occurred
in Shuiyan House.

339
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:26.600
Lianxiang was assassinated

340
00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.970
in her room last night.

341
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.170
Lianxiang was assassinated?

342
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:29.800
Yes.

343
00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.080
What's the situation at the scene?

344
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.120
Mr. Liu and Mr. Li

345
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.170
have gone to the scene

346
00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.800
and found Her Ladyship's
jade pendant

347
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.170
in Lianxiang's room.

348
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.250
What?

349
00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:40.930
(Shuiyan House)

350
00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:41.450
Sir.

351
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.800
This jade pendant can be used
as physical evidence.

352
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.210
Was it found in this room?

353
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:45.650
Yes.

354
00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:46.730
You've asked everyone?

355
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.450
Right.

356
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.210
Everyone said that

357
00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.560
this physical evidence is true.

358
00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:50.970
I see.

359
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:53.890
Mr. Ning.

360
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.840
You came just in time.

361
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.010
As identified by many maids
of Haoxue Cosmetics,

362
00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.250
the jade pendant found
in the room of the deceased

363
00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.080
was the same one worn

364
00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.040
by Her Lordship Nie Sangyu

365
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:06.490
during the banquet

366
00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.560
at Shuiyan House

367
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.600
last night.

368
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.360
It does belong to my wife.

369
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.280
But one object alone

370
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.320
is not enough to convict her.

371
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.320
Not enough?

372
00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.250
Mr. Ning.

373
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.080
This jade pendant

374
00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:36.650
is obviously something precious.

375
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:38.450
Mrs. Ning must wear it every day

376
00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.800
and keep it carefully.

377
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.360
Now it appeared
at the scene of the crime,

378
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.010
which can be described
as conclusive evidence.

379
00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.010
Mr. Ning,

380
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.800
are you trying to call white black?

381
00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:50.120
Mr. Wang.

382
00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.040
What a coincidence.

383
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:53.450
Why are you here

384
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.650
all of a sudden?

385
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:55.800
The matter

386
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.970
has something to do
with the Sea Trade Guild's reputation.

387
00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.010
Of course we are very concerned.

388
00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:02.280
Nie Sangyu

389
00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:04.010
is not only Mr. Ning's wife,

390
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.800
but also a lady with imperial mandate.

391
00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.970
Now she's committed a murder.

392
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.800
As the magistrate,

393
00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.490
Mr. Ning,

394
00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.600
please enforce the law impartially,

395
00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.320
return justice to the deceased

396
00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.800
and return dignity to the law.

397
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:29.970
Gui Bai.

398
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.520
Convey my order.

399
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:35.760
Arrest the suspect

400
00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:37.170
Nie Sangyu immediately.

401
00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:38.560
Yes, sir.

402
00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:50.970
Let me go.

403
00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:54.450
Let me go.

404
00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.210
Why are you arresting me?

405
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.360
Why are you arresting me?

406
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.690
Help!

407
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:16.490
Your Ladyship.

408
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:18.170
Sir.

409
00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:18.840
Open the door.

410
00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:19.490
Yes.

411
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:21.600
Mr. Qin.

412
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.610
- What happened?
- Hush.

413
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:27.800
Lianxiang was assassinated

414
00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.650
at Shuiyan House last night.

415
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.010
What?

416
00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.010
How is she now?

417
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.120
She succumbed to the injury.

418
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:41.650
Your Ladyship.

419
00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:42.970
Take a seat.

420
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:50.730
I see.

421
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.890
Because of what happened
in Shuiyan House yesterday,

422
00:25:54.890 --> 00:25:55.280
I am now

423
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:56.490
the prime suspect.

424
00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:57.770
The most serious thing is that

425
00:25:58.450 --> 00:25:59.690
your jade pendant was found

426
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.210
at the scene where Lianxiang
was murdered.

427
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.450
The jade pendant...

428
00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:19.280
They must have stolen it

429
00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:20.650
and tried to frame me.

430
00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:24.120
Right.

431
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:25.320
Your Ladyship.

432
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:26.760
Where did you go after

433
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.280
you left Shuiyan House last night?
Any witnesses?

434
00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:33.360
Last night...

435
00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:36.360
Last night

436
00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:37.730
I had been staying
in Haoxue Cosmetics

437
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.410
and never left.

438
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:41.600
But the only witness

439
00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.520
is Ning Yuxuan.

440
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.840
Given our relationship,

441
00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:47.760
this is simply not enough evidence.

442
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:51.890
Mr. Qin.

443
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:53.690
They must have targeted me

444
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:55.930
about this.

445
00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:56.450
So

446
00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:58.080
Lianxiang was implicated by me.

447
00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:00.730
Find out the murderer
as soon as possible,

448
00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.490
and don't let her die in vain.

449
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:03.800
Your Ladyship, don't worry.

450
00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.010
Mr. Ning is on it.

451
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:06.490
He will definitely find out the truth.

452
00:27:07.690 --> 00:27:09.560
These days, you may have to stay here.

453
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:11.120
Take care of yourself.

454
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.250
I have to go.

455
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.120
Okay.

456
00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.380
(Shuiyan House)

457
00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.040
Miss Shui.

458
00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:37.520
I have some questions

459
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:38.930
for you about

460
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:40.890
what happened to my wife.

461
00:27:41.250 --> 00:27:42.360
I know very little.

462
00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:44.730
I can't tell you much.

463
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:45.600
You were the first to discover that

464
00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.130
Lianxiang was killed this morning.

465
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:51.040
Yes.

466
00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:53.600
She had been dead for a long time

467
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:55.450
when I found her.

468
00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:57.760
And there was no trace of a fight

469
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:58.560
at the scene.

470
00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.690
Then I notified the local government.

471
00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.010
They found your wife's

472
00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.360
jade pendant right there.

473
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.560
Anything else?

474
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.650
Please think carefully

475
00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.040
if there is anything strange.

476
00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.120
Miss Shui.

477
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.930
You have had contact

478
00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.040
with my wife.

479
00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.280
You know her

480
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:30.600
better than anyone.

481
00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:32.840
The current situation is against her.

482
00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:34.730
Your words

483
00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:35.890
are very important to us

484
00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:37.360
if we are to prove her innocence.

485
00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:43.840
Since you knew she was wronged,

486
00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:45.840
why did you

487
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:47.520
put her in the cell?

488
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.280
I...

489
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:52.730
Of course I have my reasons

490
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.250
for doing this.

491
00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.560
That's all I know.

492
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.320
If there is nothing else,

493
00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:03.210
please go back.

494
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:13.080
Gui Bai.

495
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:15.930
What do you think of this?

496
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.650
Your Lordship.

497
00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.450
I don't understand.

498
00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.520
Now that Her Ladyship is innocent,

499
00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.320
why were you in such a hurry

500
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:25.600
to put her in prison?

501
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.970
She's a titled lady.

502
00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:31.690
And it involves murder.

503
00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.360
If this matter is reported
to the capital,

504
00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.010
it will definitely alarm those
of the Court of Judicial Review.

505
00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:36.690
It's the best way

506
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.280
I can think of

507
00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:39.450
now.

508
00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.410
It's just that I can't

509
00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.840
explain it to others.

510
00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.410
Now I understand

511
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:46.650
your difficulties.

512
00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:48.840
What do you think of

513
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:50.490
the words of Miss Shui?

514
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:51.890
I don't think

515
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:55.320
Miss Shui told the full story.

516
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.210
And she seems to be afraid
and hiding something.

517
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.170
It seems she doesn't trust me.

518
00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:03.490
Well,

519
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:05.410
follow her these days.

520
00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:07.410
Report to me in time

521
00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.010
if anything happens.

522
00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:09.650
Yes, sir.

523
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.560
Your Lordship.

524
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.970
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

525
00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:39.320
Leave us alone.

526
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.250
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

527
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:48.490
I don't want to see you.

528
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:49.320
Why are you here?

529
00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:50.410
Eat something.

530
00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.410
Health goes first.

531
00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.210
What about Lianxiang?

532
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.970
After the forensic doctor
finishes the autopsy,

533
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.120
I will ask someone
to arrange her funeral.

534
00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:08.410
Can you eat now?

535
00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.600
I brought your favorite roast chicken,

536
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:11.730
pancakes,

537
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:13.040
and

538
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:15.600
trotters.

539
00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:25.760
I have also brought

540
00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.320
your pillow

541
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.250
and bedding.

542
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:31.450
Am I going to live here
for a long time?

543
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.600
It's complicated.

544
00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:34.890
My wife.

545
00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:36.010
Don't call me that.

546
00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.280
I'm not your wife at all.

547
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.930
We have nothing to do

548
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:39.890
with each other now.

549
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:47.730
Mr. Ning, hurry up and find out

550
00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.170
the real culprit who killed Lianxiang.

551
00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:51.360
Okay.

552
00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.730
Eat something first.

553
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.170
I don't want to eat.

554
00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:57.210
With you here,

555
00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.450
I have no appetite at all.

556
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.320
Get out.

557
00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:03.600
I...

558
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:05.170
Leave!

559
00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.800
If you want to eat anything,

560
00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.930
tell the jailer.

561
00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:15.490
I'll prepare for you.

562
00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:19.360
Ning Yuxuan.

563
00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:26.650
The death of Lianxiang

564
00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:27.730
remains unsolved.

565
00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:28.890
But after all,

566
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:31.010
she died because of me.

567
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:31.840
So please

568
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:33.320
find out the real culprit,

569
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.490
uphold justice for her,

570
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.520
and give her an explanation.

571
00:32:37.410 --> 00:32:38.120
I promise I will.

572
00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:55.170
Boss.

573
00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:56.970
How is it going?

574
00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.040
Any updates?

575
00:32:58.450 --> 00:32:58.970
We made secret inquiries

576
00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.560
from all the merchants
around Shuiyan House.

577
00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:01.280
They said

578
00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:01.840
they didn't see anyone suspicious

579
00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:03.210
that night.

580
00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:07.210
You only checked the merchants?

581
00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:09.600
Since the other party came prepared,

582
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.280
how could that person

583
00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:11.490
swagger in?

584
00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:13.250
Keep digging.

585
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:14.320
Check all the people

586
00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:15.760
who passed by Shuiyan House

587
00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:16.760
that night.

588
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.840
Yes.

589
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:19.840
Hold on.

590
00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:24.840
Don't just check the Shuiyan House.

591
00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:26.250
Have you ever thought about

592
00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.210
how Ms. Nie

593
00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.650
lost the jade pendant?

594
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.600
About what happened in Xiajiu House,

595
00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:33.450
there may be some clues

596
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.890
in the Dragon Gang.

597
00:33:35.520 --> 00:33:36.320
Go check it out.

598
00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:37.800
Remember

599
00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:39.560
to be careful.

600
00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:42.010
Go.

601
00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:43.370
Go.

602
00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:51.930
Is everything settled?

603
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.080
Your Lordship, don't worry.

604
00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.010
I have followed your arrangement

605
00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.170
and have been against

606
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.210
Ning Yuxuan head-on.

607
00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.250
I'm afraid that in the future...

608
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.840
Are you still worried about yourself?

609
00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.600
If Ning Yuxuan is not eliminated,

610
00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:09.890
do you think

611
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:12.890
you can escape?

612
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:17.420
Shen Liancheng

613
00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.490
has already settled the matter.

614
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:20.370
Next

615
00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:23.970
it's your turn.

616
00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.200
Got it.

617
00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.120
Let's go to that store.

618
00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:34.600
Let's go.

619
00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:39.560
Coming.

620
00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.370
Sirs.

621
00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:54.770
This is your task.

622
00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:56.890
This is

623
00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.720
what you need.

624
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.370
Master.

625
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.290
It's done.

626
00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.640
Make it quick.

627
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:18.640
Ning Yuxuan is really

628
00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:20.490
indulged in wishful thinking.

629
00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:21.370
On the surface,

630
00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:22.160
he sent his wife to prison

631
00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:23.330
to suffer.

632
00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:25.290
In fact, he is protecting her

633
00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.640
under his own nose.

634
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.080
Don't worry, Master.

635
00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.970
Those we hired

636
00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:30.680
are all men of sacrifice

637
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:32.560
with the strongest martial arts
in Haifang.

638
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:35.520
It is said that they are
quite professional

639
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.410
and never fail.

640
00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:45.010
With this confession,

641
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.680
the lady with imperial mandate

642
00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:48.770
will become a murderer

643
00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:51.370
personally taken over
by the Court of Judicial Review.

644
00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:54.200
No matter how powerful
Ning Yuxuan is,

645
00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.290
he can only be sent to the capital

646
00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.160
with his murderer wife.

647
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.560
And no one can save him then.

648
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:19.600
Go.

649
00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.410
What do you want to do?

650
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:34.520
Mrs. Ning.

651
00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:35.720
Sorry for that.

652
00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.450
We have never entertained anyone

653
00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.120
of such esteem as you.

654
00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:40.770
Forgive us

655
00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:41.890
for our poor hospitality.

656
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.200
But

657
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:45.850
as long as

658
00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:46.680
you sign the confession,

659
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:48.370
I will let you down immediately

660
00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.040
(Confession)
and serve you fine food and drink.

661
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.720
Confession?

662
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.080
I didn't kill anyone.

663
00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.450
Why should I sign this?

664
00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.330
Where is Ning Yuxuan?

665
00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:58.890
Ask him over.

666
00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:00.410
Mr. Ning is handling a case.

667
00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.490
He sent the two of us over

668
00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.080
to get you to sign.

669
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.540
(Confess to killing
the singsong girl Lianxiang...)

670
00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.290
You don't work for him.

671
00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:15.680
Who sent you over?

672
00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.160
You chose the hard way.

673
00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.010
I don't have time

674
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.080
to waste with you.

675
00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.370
Mrs. Ning.

676
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.560
The soldering iron is just the appetizer.

677
00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.290
Let me ask you one last time.

678
00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.040
Will you sign it or not?

679
00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.010
You rat!

680
00:37:56.770 --> 00:37:57.640
Nuts!

681
00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.160
Don't move! Behave yourself!

682
00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.490
Take them away.

683
00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:51.370
Interrogate them carefully.

684
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:52.200
- Yes.
- Yes.

685
00:38:52.370 --> 00:38:53.890
- Go.
- Get up.

686
00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.120
Go.

687
00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:08.410
Everyone.

688
00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.640
Thank you for attending

689
00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:12.040
my birthday party today.

690
00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:14.450
I hope you to have fun.

691
00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.080
Cheers to all.

692
00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:17.200
Cheers.

693
00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:18.120
Of course.

694
00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.720
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

695
00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.240
Please.

696
00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:22.560
More wine.

697
00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:24.160
- Okay.
- Great.

698
00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:24.850
More wine for you.

699
00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:25.330
Okay.

700
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:26.450
Come on.

701
00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.290
More wine.

702
00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:31.770
- Okay.
- Okay.

703
00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.290
Sorry, everyone.

704
00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:47.720
The guzheng has been in disrepair
all year round,

705
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:48.810
and the strings
were accidentally broken.

706
00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:49.770
I'll ask the maid

707
00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:51.120
to get a new one,

708
00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.640
and I'll play again for you.

709
00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:56.160
Miss Shui.

710
00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:57.640
Today is my birthday,

711
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.040
but you broke the strings
to congratulate me.

712
00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.770
What do you mean?

713
00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:02.080
Are you cursing me
to an early death?

714
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.560
Mr. Wang, I'm sorry.

715
00:40:03.930 --> 00:40:06.080
It's an inadvertent mistake.

716
00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.240
Please forgive me.

717
00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:08.490
Forgive you?

718
00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:11.930
Okay.

719
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:16.520
Drink with me.

720
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:17.890
And I will forgive you.

721
00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:20.240
- Right, come on.
- Come on.

722
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.080
- Come on.
- Come on.

723
00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:21.680
Take this.

724
00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:23.410
Come on.

725
00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.490
Drink with us.

726
00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:26.640
This...

727
00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:27.680
Don't make trouble.

728
00:40:28.010 --> 00:40:29.600
Who are you?

729
00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:30.970
Do you know

730
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.120
how much I spent on her?

731
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:33.810
Mr. Gui, please show mercy.

732
00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:36.010
I'm just a singsong girl.

733
00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:37.850
Thanks to the appreciation
of everyone present,

734
00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:38.770
I am able to make a living

735
00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.040
in Haifang.

736
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:41.240
Exactly.

737
00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:42.010
You!

738
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.360
Okay, I won't hurt you.

739
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:47.490
I'll drink

740
00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:50.410
for Miss Shui.

741
00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:54.200
Are you trying to

742
00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.970
get her out of a fix?

743
00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:58.410
Then it's not about a glass of wine.

744
00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.370
- Yes.
- Right.

745
00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:00.450
- Exactly.
- That's it.

746
00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.560
A glass of wine is too easy for you.

747
00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.680
Indeed.

748
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:04.640
It's okay.

749
00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:06.120
I am here.

750
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.010
I'm not leaving today.

751
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:25.370
Leave.

752
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:28.930
Get out.

753
00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:29.930
Be careful.

754
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.410
It's okay if you don't let me in.

755
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.080
I'm at the door anyway.

756
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.080
I'm not leaving today.

757
00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:54.120
Don't think that
after you saved me today,

758
00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:54.810
our affairs

759
00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:55.770
will be written off.

760
00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:02.010
Ji Man.

761
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.850
I admit that

762
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.720
I lied to you.

763
00:42:12.010 --> 00:42:13.200
I hurt you.

764
00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:18.240
