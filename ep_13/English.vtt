00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.940
(Magistrate's Residence)

4
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.250
Why are you staring at me?

5
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.010
Turn around.

6
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.410
Why did you wake me up this early?

7
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.970
I told you not to…

8
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.160
My goodness.

9
00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.250
How come there are so many flowers?

10
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.640
Who put them here?

11
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.480
They are all my favorites.

12
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.370
There are even flowers on the table.

13
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.320
So beautiful.

14
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.040
Who put the flowers here?

15
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.440
Who did it?

16
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.370
It's you, isn't it?

17
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.640
No way.

18
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.850
We didn't

19
00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.920
have a steward before.

20
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.440
Now that we have a steward now,

21
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.920
of course we should

22
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.600
redecorate our house.

23
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.440
Steward?

24
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.810
Looks like this steward and I

25
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.920
have a lot in common.

26
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.160
The flowers he picked

27
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.410
are all my favorites.

28
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.370
Right?

29
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.440
Why did you

30
00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.290
cook so much meat?

31
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.130
The meat was cooked

32
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.440
by different chefs.

33
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.250
Give it a try,

34
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.760
see which tastes like

35
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.090
the flavor in Chen's Mansion the most.

36
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.880
The flavor in Chen's Mansion?

37
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.810
The one I mentioned to you before?

38
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.520
You prepared

39
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.880
all these, didn't you?

40
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.250
It's the steward who said

41
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.640
the chef in the Chen's Mansion
is the best.

42
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.370
Gui Bai,

43
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.440
make sure

44
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.690
to find a chef

45
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.640
as good as him.

46
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:36.320
Yes.

47
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.370
So weird.

48
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.170
This is the flavor.

49
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.250
Tell the chef

50
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.840
to follow this recipe.

51
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.570
Okay.

52
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.610
Oh, no.

53
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.050
I still need to work
on some new products in my shop.

54
00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.960
I have to go now.

55
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.080
But the meat...

56
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.610
Can I take the meat with me?

57
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.490
Of course.

58
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.280
Thank you.

59
00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.640
And thank you for the flowers.

60
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.170
You are welcome.

61
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.930
Your Lordship,

62
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.580
here's a letter

63
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:25.980
from Lord Qin.

64
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.220
Alright. Read it to me.

65
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.980
I wish to find someone to be with.

66
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.300
And nothing can do us apart.

67
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.100
Near, far, I've been looking for you.

68
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.100
The moment I stop looking,
there you are.

69
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.900
Though only once a year we meet
in the time of sharp wind and chill dew,

70
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.740
we are many times happier
than the lovers on earth.

71
00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.780
My heart is a cobweb doubled over,

72
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.580
tied and knotted with a million frets.

73
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.780
What

74
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.220
does he mean?

75
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.540
I see that you haven't

76
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.780
been yourself lately,

77
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.340
and I know you don't like
to see a doctor,

78
00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:58.900
so I wrote a letter to Lord Qin

79
00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.900
and told him about your situation.

80
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.100
Since when did you

81
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.780
become so nosy?

82
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.540
You may leave now.

83
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.020
What he meant

84
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.740
is that you are jealous.

85
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.100
How could I be…

86
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.240
Be…

87
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.540
Am I jealous?

88
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.220
(Face Cream
Haoxue Cosmetics)

89
00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.660
35 taels in total.

90
00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.100
This much?

91
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.780
How come no one visits?

92
00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.420
It's been a whole morning.

93
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.860
Muxu,

94
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.220
come here.

95
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.660
Did we receive any guests

96
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.860
while I was away?

97
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.100
Not a single soul.

98
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.100
It's okay.

99
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.660
It's normal since we just opened today.

100
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:29.660
Your Ladyship.

101
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.540
His Lordship is here.

102
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.180
What are you doing there?

103
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.980
You don't have work to do?

104
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.980
I'm on a tour of inspection,

105
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:37.860
and I'm passing by here.

106
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:38.980
I'm thirsty.

107
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.980
Could you get me some water?

108
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.420
That's enough.

109
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.580
Here, have some tea.

110
00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.900
That's it?

111
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.900
This is good tea.

112
00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.020
You want it or not?

113
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.020
Forget it, then.

114
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.740
How petty you are.

115
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.020
I'm your husband.

116
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.860
You won't even offer me some tea.

117
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.980
Even a cup of tea costs me money.

118
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:18.740
You have no idea

119
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.420
how much money I've lost

120
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.900
to run this shop.

121
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.540
Look,

122
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:22.420
based on my calculation,

123
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.100
the flowers and herbs

124
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:23.780
cost me

125
00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:24.900
15 taels of silver today,

126
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:25.540
including

127
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.980
pearl powder, 10 pence for each mace,

128
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.340
coral, 10 pence for each mace.

129
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:29.100
On top of that,

130
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.540
conch, five pence for each mace.

131
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.980
And that's 15 taels altogether.

132
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:32.620
Aside from that,

133
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.700
the shipping tax cost me 20 taels.

134
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:34.780
Come to think of it,
the price level in Haifang

135
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:35.700
is even higher
than that in the capital.

136
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:36.780
How am I supposed to do business here?

137
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.140
That's right.

138
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:37.660
Hold it.

139
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:41.060
You said the shipping tax was 20 taels?

140
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:41.540
Yes.

141
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.900
It was already reduced to two taels

142
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.020
for each shipload three years ago.

143
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.180
Are you sure?

144
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.420
I confirmed it back then.

145
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.420
It can't be wrong.

146
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.620
I can't believe they tricked me.

147
00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.780
I'll go confront them.

148
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.420
Your Ladyship…

149
00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.660
That's too much. How dare they…

150
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.660
Your Lordship,

151
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.900
don't you think you should go…

152
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:08.900
With you?

153
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.940
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

154
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.180
Don't you feel ashamed to come back?

155
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.660
Chief,

156
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:21.540
(Shen Liancheng)
there was nothing I could do.

157
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.500
Our men

158
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:23.700
have suffered a lot

159
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.420
these days.

160
00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.060
Do you know how much money I'd lose

161
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.540
after Jiumu Casino was seized?

162
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.180
I know.

163
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.420
Of course I do, Chief.

164
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:34.820
Chief,

165
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.260
come to think of it,

166
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:37.780
the whole thing was kinda weird.

167
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:38.780
Not only did we bump

168
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.060
into that tough nut Ning Yuxuan,

169
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.540
but the two men we sent

170
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.940
to kidnap his wife

171
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.420
also got beaten up badly.

172
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.300
Apparently,

173
00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.300
those people

174
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.540
are highly skilled in martial arts.

175
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:51.900
What's the point of keeping

176
00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:53.020
a bunch of losers like you?

177
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.180
Chief,

178
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.140
a man named Yuan Lang
is here to see you.

179
00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:05.500
I don't know him.

180
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:06.500
Let him leave.

181
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:07.500
He said he hurt

182
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.660
our men by accident,

183
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:09.820
so he's here to apologize.

184
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.020
Chief,

185
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.300
it could be the guy

186
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.020
who saved Mrs. Ning

187
00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.020
outside the casino.

188
00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:19.180
Let them in.

189
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:20.300
Yes.

190
00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.180
Let them in.

191
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.780
Greetings, Chief Shen.

192
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.380
I'm Yuan Lang.

193
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.420
They are my buddies,

194
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.660
Zhao Long and Zhao Hu.

195
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.700
Do you know what this place is?

196
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:47.660
You've got the nerve to come here.

197
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.060
Guys…

198
00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:59.060
Chief Shen,

199
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:01.300
saving that girl

200
00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:02.540
was an accident.

201
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:03.380
I didn't know

202
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.540
I actually offended someone

203
00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:06.020
who's on the same side with me.

204
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.420
Who's on your side?

205
00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.420
Chief Shen,

206
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.540
the three of us

207
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.780
are traveling businessmen.

208
00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:13.660
We came to Haifang to do business.

209
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.540
I've heard so much

210
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.660
about you, Chief Shen.

211
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.140
And I was going to pay you a visit.

212
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.780
I didn't expect that my meddling

213
00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.660
would cause trouble to you.

214
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.260
So, I came here today

215
00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:23.940
to apologize to you.

216
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:30.020
The silver

217
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.420
is a small gesture from me.

218
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:32.780
Hope we can get to know each other

219
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.900
from now on.

220
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:34.820
And I hope

221
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:35.660
to have your support

222
00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:37.820
in Haifang in the future.

223
00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.500
Whoever follows the lead

224
00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.700
of our Dragon Gang in Haifang

225
00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.060
is considered our friend.

226
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:03.660
Thank you, Chief Shen.

227
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:06.700
Please accept my respect.

228
00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:13.660
Work harder, guys.

229
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.660
Hurry up.

230
00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.940
The ship owners

231
00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.180
refuse to pay tax these days.

232
00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:18.260
Li San,

233
00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.900
let me ask you.

234
00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.020
I just bought a shipload

235
00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:21.660
of sea goods from you.

236
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.780
You still remember me, right?

237
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.660
You overcharged me the shipping tax,

238
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.900
didn't you?

239
00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:27.660
Mrs. Ning,

240
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:28.900
the shipping tax

241
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.620
has always been
20 taels for each shipload.

242
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.900
If you buy sea goods from us,

243
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:32.540
you'll have to pay

244
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.660
the shipping tax.

245
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.300
This has been the rule for years.

246
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.660
I didn't overcharge you.

247
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:38.020
Oh, yeah?

248
00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:39.420
Yeah.

249
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.420
Wait a sec,

250
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.940
you did overcharge me.

251
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.620
This is an illegal ship.

252
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:45.660
No, this is…

253
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.540
How could you say this ship is illegal?

254
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.060
The shipping tax
has always been 20 taels.

255
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.180
There's no problem.

256
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:51.660
What?

257
00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.140
You guys also paid 20?

258
00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:53.900
Yes.

259
00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.660
There's no proof.

260
00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.900
Why do I believe you?

261
00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:58.700
Mrs. Ning,

262
00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.060
we are all hard-working

263
00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:00.900
businessmen.

264
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:01.940
How could we unconscionably

265
00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:02.900
overcharge you?

266
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:03.420
That's right.

267
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:04.940
If you don't believe us,

268
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.620
Registrar Liu from
the government is right there,

269
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:08.140
you can ask him.

270
00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.780
What's going on? Why the noise?

271
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:12.420
- Registrar Liu.
- Registrar Liu.

272
00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.180
What is it?

273
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.020
Registrar Liu,

274
00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.500
good that you are here.

275
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.060
Mrs. Ning,

276
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.380
what brings you here?

277
00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.660
Here's the thing, Registrar Liu.

278
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:23.420
I just

279
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.380
bought a shipload

280
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.940
of sea goods from Li San.

281
00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.020
But he charged me

282
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.140
20 taels for shipping tax.

283
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.140
Do you think

284
00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:32.820
he overcharged me?

285
00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.140
I didn't.

286
00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:34.900
- There's no problem.
- Well…

287
00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:37.900
Mrs. Ning,

288
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.180
may I talk to you in private?

289
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.500
Why in private?

290
00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.900
Let's talk right here.

291
00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.140
Registrar Liu,

292
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:50.500
is it that hard to say a number?

293
00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.380
How much exactly?

294
00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.900
We charged

295
00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:00.660
two taels.

296
00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.260
How could it be two?

297
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:02.940
Two?

298
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:03.940
How come it's two?

299
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.180
I didn't hear you.

300
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.900
You said 20 taels

301
00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.620
or two?

302
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.540
We charged

303
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.180
two taels.

304
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.140
Two taels?

305
00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.540
But we all paid 20.

306
00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.260
That's right.

307
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:24.420
I just paid 20 yesterday.

308
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:28.260
Registrar Liu, are you sure?

309
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.060
The shipping tax

310
00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.020
has always been 20 taels

311
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.260
in Haifang these years.

312
00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.420
It's always been 20.

313
00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.140
That's right.

314
00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.140
Explain it.

315
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:37.660
What are you doing?

316
00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:38.780
Come on,

317
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:40.300
get rid of the mob.

318
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.540
Get rid of them.

319
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.700
Magistrate Ning is here.

320
00:14:42.820 --> 00:14:43.820
Magistrate Ning.

321
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:44.780
Magistrate Ning is here.

322
00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.660
Registrar Liu,

323
00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.060
why is it so loud here

324
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.660
on the pier?

325
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.300
Your Lordship,

326
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.620
what brings you here?

327
00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:58.620
Your Lordship,

328
00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.020
the government always charges us

329
00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.260
20 taels of silver for shipping tax.

330
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.020
How come he claims

331
00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:02.940
it's only two?

332
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:03.420
That's right.

333
00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:03.900
Your Lordship,

334
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.660
you've got to seek justice for us.

335
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:07.700
Why are we charged 20?

336
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.820
Your Lordship, seek justice for us.

337
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.820
One claims it's 20,

338
00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.900
and the other claims it's two.

339
00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:14.660
Fine.

340
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.300
Gui Bai,

341
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:17.780
seize the tax money

342
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.140
and check the account book.

343
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.020
Yes.

344
00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:21.660
Check it carefully.

345
00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:22.940
A check is necessary.

346
00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:23.780
It should've been checked long time ago.

347
00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.660
He charged us so much money.

348
00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.700
That's a lot.

349
00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:27.060
It's all our hard-earned money.

350
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.780
Exactly.

351
00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:28.700
Two taels.

352
00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:29.420
He embezzled it all.

353
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.140
Check thoroughly.

354
00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.660
We all paid 20.

355
00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:32.300
Check it.

356
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:33.700
Yeah, check it thoroughly.

357
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:34.660
There's got to be a problem.

358
00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.420
(Shipping tax Two taels)
Find out what's going on.

359
00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.660
Check it carefully.

360
00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:38.140
Sure enough, it records here

361
00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:39.300
two taels for each shipload.

362
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.020
And it should be 178 taels in total.

363
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:42.820
You, however, charged

364
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.420
1,780 taels altogether.

365
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:45.820
Let me see.

366
00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.940
(Shipping tax Two taels)

367
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.500
It really says here
two taels for each shipload.

368
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:51.660
Registrar Liu,

369
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.780
I need an explanation.

370
00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:56.260
Well…

371
00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.900
It's only the difference for three days.

372
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.940
What about the difference
for three years? Where's the money?

373
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:03.060
That's right.

374
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.160
- Where's the money?
- Where is it?

375
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.420
Where's the money?

376
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.890
Give us an explanation.

377
00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.660
Give us our hard-earned money back.

378
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.620
He's so evil.

379
00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.700
That's a lot of money.

380
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:10.380
I…

381
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.380
Your… Your Lordship,

382
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.900
the money

383
00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:17.180
was given to the Dragon Gang
for suppressing bandits.

384
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.140
What?

385
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:18.700
Suppress bandits?

386
00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.900
You used our money
to suppress bandits?

387
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:20.620
How could you?

388
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.180
Fine,

389
00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.300
let's go to the Dragon Gang right now.

390
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.540
Look, doesn't Mrs. Ning

391
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.900
look like Miss Ji?

392
00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:35.940
Yeah?

393
00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:37.500
She does look like her.

394
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:38.500
Right?

395
00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:40.380
I guess you are right.

396
00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.540
You are the chief of the Dragon Gang?

397
00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:56.900
That's right.

398
00:16:57.620 --> 00:16:59.540
Your Lordship, why do you come here

399
00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:01.420
instead of doing your work?

400
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.060
I came here

401
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.780
because I have questions for you.

402
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.740
It's said you've been holding

403
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:06.740
a certain amount of government money.

404
00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:14.620
That's right.

405
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.900
Our Dragon Gang

406
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:18.620
helps Haifang
suppress bandits every year,

407
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.420
so the government pays us for it.

408
00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.460
The government pays you

409
00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:24.900
for suppressing bandits.

410
00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:27.700
Good.

411
00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.180
Very well.

412
00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:31.420
Then how come

413
00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.460
there's no such an item recorded

414
00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.620
in the account book of the government?

415
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:34.700
The money was paid to us

416
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:36.340
directly from the dock.

417
00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.060
It was not through the government.

418
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.940
If it's not recorded by the government,

419
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.860
you must keep an account book, right?

420
00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:46.460
I'm here today to check it.

421
00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.620
You are just a magistrate.

422
00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.140
Do you know how to read an account book?

423
00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:01.500
Watch your mouth.

424
00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.060
Even if my husband doesn't know,

425
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:03.900
I do.

426
00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:05.620
This is my wife,

427
00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.820
and she's a Second-rank Lady
with Imperial Mandate.

428
00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.420
She's good at keeping and checking

429
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.700
financial accounts.

430
00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:11.420
Chief Shen, watch your tone

431
00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.060
when you talk to her.

432
00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.380
Second-rank?

433
00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:18.620
Fine.

434
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:20.500
Go ahead.

435
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.020
(Account Book)

436
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:45.780
(Weapon purchase
300 taels of silver in total)

437
00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.380
The accounts are incorrect.

438
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.460
How?

439
00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.940
Based on the records,

440
00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.180
you spent 300 taels of sliver
on weapon purchase,

441
00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.260
but there are only

442
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.900
30 pieces of weapon

443
00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:57.740
on record.

444
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.060
Besides, it says here that you spent

445
00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.900
520 taels of sliver on provisions.

446
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.260
But based on the current market price

447
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.820
of rice and forage,

448
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.380
100 kg of rice

449
00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.420
and 150 kg of forage

450
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.220
would cost much less

451
00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.340
than 520 taels of sliver.

452
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.060
Also, Chief Shen,

453
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.060
according to your accounts,

454
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.260
the government paid you

455
00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:19.100
5,981 taels of silver in total,

456
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.900
while you only spent

457
00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:22.900
800.

458
00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.060
The difference is roughly

459
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.060
5,000 taels of silver.

460
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.660
You calculated wrong.

461
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.380
It's recorded clearly here

462
00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.340
in black and white.

463
00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.860
How was she wrong?

464
00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.220
It's been the rule in Haifang for years.

465
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:51.980
Are you going

466
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.580
to break it?

467
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:54.420
I don't care

468
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.900
what the rule was before.

469
00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.980
Now that I'm here,

470
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.180
everything must go
by the rules of the court.

471
00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.660
And I won't let those who try

472
00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:05.500
to make trouble get their way.

473
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.220
What?

474
00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:21.460
You are going to fight us?

475
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.820
(Account Book)
How would I dare

476
00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:29.420
to offend a court official?

477
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:35.340
Good that you know it.

478
00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:36.660
I came here today

479
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:37.900
to inform you

480
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.100
that the government will no longer

481
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:42.660
pay anything to the Dragon Gang.

482
00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:44.420
And the Yamen will be in charge

483
00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:45.900
of collecting the shipping tax
from now on

484
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.660
and turn it in to the court.

485
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.420
Got it?

486
00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.180
Let's go, dear.

487
00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.380
By the way, Chief Shen,

488
00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:05.500
the government

489
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:06.420
paid you 5,000 taels of silver

490
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.980
to suppress bandits this month.

491
00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.100
Since you only

492
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.180
spent 800,

493
00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:11.820
you should pay the rest

494
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.100
back to the government.

495
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:40.900
Who do you think this new guy

496
00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:43.140
Yuan Lang really is?

497
00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:46.420
Not sure.

498
00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:47.620
I don't know.

499
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.460
I heard

500
00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:50.980
only a few days

501
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.660
after he visited the gang chief,

502
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:53.620
he said he wanted

503
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.580
to come to my pawnshop.

504
00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:57.180
Isn't that strange?

505
00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.180
It does sound

506
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.900
a little strange.

507
00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.100
I'm Yuan Lang.

508
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:09.420
Nice to see you, Mr. Huang.

509
00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.580
Yuan, welcome.

510
00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:14.180
To be honest,

511
00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.580
I have something to ask you,

512
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:17.060
and I hope you can answer my question.

513
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.420
My pawnshop

514
00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.420
isn't as influential

515
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.420
as the other businesses in the gang,

516
00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:23.940
so the gang fellows

517
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.660
all look down upon us.

518
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.420
I wonder

519
00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.060
why you chose

520
00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.900
to visit my place.

521
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.420
What

522
00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.180
do you want exactly?

523
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.900
I'm only here to pay you
a visit, Mr. Huang.

524
00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.060
Leave us.

525
00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.140
If I may ask,

526
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.940
who are you exactly?

527
00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:06.460
How do you know

528
00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.100
the hand gesture of our Tea Gang?

529
00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:12.060
With qin I feel kinship when hearing
melodies like Clear Water,

530
00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.740
while with tea for a long time it has
been the same with Mount Meng tea.

531
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.180
Uncle Huang,

532
00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.460
I'm Lang. You don't
recognize me anymore?

533
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:24.220
You were the one who saw me off

534
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.180
when I first went down the mountain.

535
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:30.660
Lang?

536
00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.180
Lang!

537
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:33.740
It's really you.

538
00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:36.140
Come on, come here,

539
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:37.060
have a seat.

540
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.180
I didn't expect

541
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.220
that the most heroic

542
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.820
Uncle Huang back then

543
00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.180
would work

544
00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.860
for that jerk Shen Liancheng.

545
00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:50.500
Lang,

546
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.660
we did it because

547
00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.180
we had no other choice.

548
00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.140
Back then,

549
00:23:58.340 --> 00:23:59.180
Shen Liancheng

550
00:23:59.340 --> 00:23:59.940
was just a low-rank subchief

551
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:02.180
in our Tea Gang.

552
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:02.980
Later,

553
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:04.900
our Tea Gang

554
00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:06.980
was disbanded.

555
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.460
He gathered a group of his men,

556
00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.660
came to Haifang,

557
00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.260
and established the Dragon Gang.

558
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:13.380
He even stole

559
00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.220
the signs and secret codes

560
00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.820
of our Tea Gang.

561
00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.380
And because of that,

562
00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.740
those helpless

563
00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:21.500
Tea Gang members

564
00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.820
had to

565
00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.220
follow his lead.

566
00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.580
Back then,

567
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.860
our Tea Gang helped those in need

568
00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:34.700
and was engaged in good deeds.

569
00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.860
We'd never done any evil things.

570
00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.900
But the Dragon Gang

571
00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:40.660
does nothing but all kinds of evil.

572
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.140
Why do our old members

573
00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.380
work for a wicked man

574
00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.700
like Shen Liancheng?

575
00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.580
Now that I'm here,

576
00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.100
I won't allow anybody to do evil things

577
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.180
in the name of the Tea Gang.

578
00:24:59.220 --> 00:24:59.820
Uncle Huang,

579
00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.260
actually, I came to Haifang this time

580
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.820
to wipe out these gangsters

581
00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:06.740
and revive our Tea Gang.

582
00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:09.380
Uncle Huang,

583
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:10.940
would you like

584
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:11.820
to work with me?

585
00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:14.860
Sure.

586
00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.940
Young Master, I,

587
00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.820
Huang Han…

588
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:20.340
Uncle Huang.

589
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.180
...vow to follow you to death.

590
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:23.340
Uncle Huang,

591
00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:25.140
please get up.

592
00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:31.100
It's just

593
00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.500
that I'm not the real master.

594
00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.860
But I've found

595
00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:38.820
the real master.

596
00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.740
The business at the dock

597
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.740
is ruined by Ning Yuxuan and his wife.

598
00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.420
Where are we supposed to get the money

599
00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.380
they asked us to pay back?

600
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.420
Chief,

601
00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.420
this couple

602
00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.140
is like a pair of devils.

603
00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.060
I think

604
00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.260
they did it to us on purpose.

605
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.900
What's the point of saying that?

606
00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.620
Hurry and think of a way

607
00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:57.740
to solve the problem.

608
00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.620
Chief,

609
00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.660
look,

610
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.180
the pirates

611
00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:04.660
attack ships at sea,

612
00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:05.900
and Ning Yuxuan's troops

613
00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:07.460
only patrol offshore.

614
00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:08.140
Actually,

615
00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:10.180
I did find a ship filled with treasures

616
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.340
that has docked at the pier
for a long time.

617
00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:15.180
You mean Ship Guihai?

618
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.260
That's right, Chief.

619
00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:16.900
Ship Guihai it is.

620
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.140
And I've sent someone

621
00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.100
to check the ship in secret.

622
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.260
There aren't many people

623
00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.420
on the ship except

624
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.620
for a dozen

625
00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.340
of sailors and maids.

626
00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.260
Think about it.

627
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.860
If we can make

628
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.180
a fortune from the ship

629
00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.740
and send it to the capital,

630
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:30.660
we can definitely

631
00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.420
make the higher-ups

632
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:33.140
impressed.

633
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.180
Good.

634
00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.380
Very well.

635
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:39.580
Contact Hu Da right now

636
00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.460
and get it done.

637
00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:42.460
You got it.

638
00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.180
Ning Yuxuan.

639
00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.660
Ning Yuxuan.

640
00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.060
What's up?

641
00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.260
I heard

642
00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.940
you've returned the overcharged

643
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.340
tax money back to the people.

644
00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.100
Yes, I have.

645
00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:58.860
Luckily,

646
00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:00.140
we found it out in time.

647
00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:00.820
Otherwise,

648
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:01.660
the people would suffer

649
00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:02.700
a great loss.

650
00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.060
By the way,

651
00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:06.180
I've got the information

652
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.580
you asked me to check.

653
00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:09.260
You can find the family information

654
00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.220
of all businessmen,

655
00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.180
celebrities,

656
00:27:11.220 --> 00:27:12.420
and officials in Haifang

657
00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:13.420
from here.

658
00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.100
(Look, doesn't Mrs. Ning)

659
00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.260
(look like Miss Ji?)

660
00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.220
(Yeah?)

661
00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.100
(She does look like her.)

662
00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.220
(Right?)

663
00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:24.580
(I guess you are right.)

664
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.260
Have a look.

665
00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.180
I'm quite capable,

666
00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:38.380
aren't I?

667
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:40.340
See?

668
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.660
How many beads do you want?

669
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.580
It's hard to say.

670
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.580
I shouldn't ask for payment

671
00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:50.740
for doing things for the people.

672
00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.580
But since you asked me to do it…

673
00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:55.580
We can talk about it later.

674
00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.460
It did remind me

675
00:27:58.900 --> 00:27:59.980
that I've still got

676
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:01.420
work to do.

677
00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:13.140
Your Lordship,

678
00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:14.260
I just saw

679
00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:15.660
Li Ming went to the dock alone.

680
00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:16.940
He made a few secret
hand gestures to the boatmen,

681
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.660
telling them

682
00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.420
to meet at Shuiyan House tomorrow.

683
00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.140
Shuiyan House…

684
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:24.700
It seems that Shen Liancheng

685
00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.460
has lost his patience

686
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:27.340
since the Yamen took back

687
00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.660
the administration authority
over the dock.

688
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.100
Keep an eye on Shuiyan House.

689
00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.740
Let me know if something happens.

690
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.140
Yes.

691
00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:33.660
Wait.

692
00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:39.260
Have you found out anything
about the matter

693
00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:40.380
I asked you to investigate?

694
00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.900
I've sent two teams out.

695
00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.420
One team is looking for
the whereabouts of the First Lady,

696
00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:43.940
and the other

697
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.340
is looking into the identity of Miss Ji.

698
00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.620
But I haven't heard

699
00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.580
anything back yet.

700
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:53.340
Keep looking.

701
00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.460
Yes, Your Lordship.

702
00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:01.170
Could Miss Ji

703
00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.220
be your real identity?

704
00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.660
(Shuiyan House)

705
00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.180
(Shuiyan House)

706
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:26.900
Shuiyan House.

707
00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.420
This is it.

708
00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.100
Bravo. Bravo.

709
00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:54.900
Nice.

710
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.380
Bravo. Bravo.

711
00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.340
One more dance.

712
00:30:59.340 --> 00:30:59.900
Let's go.

713
00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:01.900
Yeah. One more.

714
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.660
Mr. Pei.

715
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.740
Sorry to have

716
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.580
kept you waiting.

717
00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.420
Madam Wu,

718
00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.820
remember the new product

719
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.380
glowing radiance lotion

720
00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.620
of Joy Cosmetics I told you about?

721
00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:15.900
I brought

722
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:16.740
sample bottles here

723
00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:17.580
for the girls

724
00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:18.900
before I start selling it in my store.

725
00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.060
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

726
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:22.100
Please go ahead.

727
00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.060
Okay.

728
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.420
Everybody,

729
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.740
this is the new product
glowing radiance lotion

730
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.900
of Joy Cosmetics.

731
00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.660
I've brought free sample bottles

732
00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:33.140
for all the girls here.

733
00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:35.460
The ingredient we use

734
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.180
is top-quality snake oil,

735
00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.740
which is very expensive.

736
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.340
Once you use the lotion,

737
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.500
your skin will become smooth and soft.

738
00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:42.940
Snake oil?

739
00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:43.900
And you'll be as pretty as a fairy.

740
00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:44.740
Give it a try, please.

741
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:45.660
Come on, try it.

742
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.340
Try it.

743
00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:46.980
(Glowing Radiance Lotion)

744
00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:48.580
Try it.

745
00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:49.580
Give it a try.

746
00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.500
What do you think?

747
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:51.260
Smells so good.

748
00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.820
It's so moisturizing.

749
00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:55.900
It's not snake oil.

750
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.900
What are you talking about?

751
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:02.260
Put it down

752
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.660
if you can't afford it.

753
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.100
The glowing radiance lotion

754
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.580
is nourishing and hydrating.

755
00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:08.180
It's even popular
among the aristocratic ladies

756
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.900
in the capital.

757
00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.620
Don't you dare to denigrate my product.

758
00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:13.620
I'm telling the truth.

759
00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.900
I can tell the ingredients

760
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.500
from the scent of it.

761
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.420
What?

762
00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.380
I've never heard someone

763
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.660
could tell the ingredients

764
00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:25.860
form the scent.

765
00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.220
You are bluffing.

766
00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.420
Well…

767
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.980
Sir,

768
00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:30.900
Joy Cosmetics

769
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:32.820
has been our supplier for years.

770
00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.580
You said the product was fake.

771
00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:35.900
Do you have proof?

772
00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.900
I can prove it.

773
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:40.860
Then prove it.

774
00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:41.740
Yeah.

775
00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:42.460
How can he prove that?

776
00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.580
Come on. Prove it.

777
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.900
It's all the same.

778
00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.460
Yeah.

779
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.340
It's quite simple, actually. Do you…

780
00:32:48.660 --> 00:32:49.940
Do you have chicken and water?

781
00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:50.900
Of course.

782
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.060
Waiter,

783
00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:53.860
bring us a drumstick and some water.

784
00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:54.580
What's that about?

785
00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.180
On it.

786
00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:01.140
Bro,

787
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:02.740
Lady Shui is so

788
00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.180
beautiful.

789
00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.700
When do you think

790
00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:07.940
we can see her again?

791
00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.420
See what?

792
00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.180
We are here

793
00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:13.380
for business.

794
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:14.900
If you want to see her again,

795
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:15.700
here's how,

796
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:17.100
we can kidnap her
after the business is done.

797
00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.420
I'll let her dance three days for you.

798
00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:21.420
Bro, you got to keep your word.

799
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:24.660
As you know,

800
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:26.460
animal oil and mineral oil

801
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.660
are light

802
00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.500
and thick.

803
00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:29.860
Once mixed with water,

804
00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:30.500
they'll float

805
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:31.900
on the surface of the water.

806
00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:34.180
Let's put a piece
of chicken skin into the water.

807
00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:38.260
Now, see that?

808
00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:40.740
The oil floats up.

809
00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:41.740
It really floats up.

810
00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:43.100
Now,

811
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.660
if this gentleman tells the truth

812
00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:47.900
(Glowing Radiance Lotion)
that the main ingredient of the lotion

813
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:48.820
is snake oil,

814
00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:49.580
once it's mixed with water,

815
00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:51.100
it'll also float up like this.

816
00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:52.820
If not,

817
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:53.860
it means

818
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:55.420
he used some

819
00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.380
harmful poor-quality oil,

820
00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.380
and the oil will sink down the bottom

821
00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.620
when mixed with water.

822
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:02.700
Well, I…

823
00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.180
Let's take a look.

824
00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:05.660
Wait…

825
00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.100
It really sinks down.

826
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:07.660
It sinks.

827
00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.620
It's true.

828
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:10.260
It doesn't float up.

829
00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:13.180
Turns out, the lotion

830
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.620
is made from harmful poor-quality oil.

831
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.140
You are such a profiteer.

832
00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:18.340
What a profiteer.

833
00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:19.740
Everybody,

834
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.980
don't listen to his lies.

835
00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:23.380
He's destroying my business on purpose.

836
00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:23.930
He's trying to destroy…

837
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:25.060
Mr. Pei,

838
00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.860
the proof is right here.

839
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:28.140
Stop making excuses.

840
00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:28.660
That's right.

841
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.860
Looks like the products

842
00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:31.940
you gave us before were also fake.

843
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:33.020
Well…

844
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.660
That's right. How unscrupulous.

845
00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:35.820
Sir,

846
00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:37.500
you know very well

847
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:38.180
what kind of ingredients

848
00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.580
you used.

849
00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:40.860
And

850
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:41.860
you know the ingredients

851
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.620
will do harm to one's skin

852
00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:44.820
and health if used

853
00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:45.980
for a long time.

854
00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:49.020
If you think I wronged you,

855
00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.180
we can let the government
decide who's right.

856
00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.100
Madam Wu, it's my bad.

857
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.180
I made a mistake.

858
00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:58.660
I'll go back right now

859
00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.580
and return the money

860
00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.020
you've paid back.

861
00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:03.980
Please don't report it to the government

862
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:05.740
for old time's sake.

863
00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:06.380
Okay?

864
00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.380
You must pay me the money back.

865
00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.700
Yeah, get the money back.

866
00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.460
That's right.

867
00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:11.140
We should report it to the government.

868
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:11.820
Of course he must pay the money back.

869
00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:12.180
That's right.

870
00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:12.640
Exactly.

871
00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:13.150
Piss off.

872
00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.660
Okay.

873
00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.180
Don't let me see you again.

874
00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:18.300
Get out of here.

875
00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:19.860
Alright, it's over. Stop watching.

876
00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:20.700
Come on, let's go.

877
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:21.300
Let's go.

878
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:23.780
Thank you for your help.

879
00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:24.740
Otherwise,

880
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.380
we'd be fooled by him again.

881
00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:28.340
I only know a little about cosmetics.

882
00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.620
So, I…

883
00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.340
I forgot to introduce myself.

884
00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:33.980
I'm the owner of this place.

885
00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:34.940
My last name is Wu.

886
00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.780
You are the owner of this place?

887
00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.620
Yes.

888
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.380
So nice to meet you.

889
00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:42.780
Allow me to introduce myself.

890
00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:43.580
My name is Nie Sangyu,

891
00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.100
and I'm the owner of Haoxue Cosmetics.

892
00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:46.700
Haoxue Cosmetics?

893
00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:48.260
It's a new shop.

894
00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:49.020
A new shop?

895
00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:49.940
Yes, it's new.

896
00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.100
Just now, I…

897
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.060
Shui, come here.

898
00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:55.260
Come on.

899
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.060
What's up?

900
00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.260
Let me introduce.

901
00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.140
This

902
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.820
is Miss Shui,

903
00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.100
the No. 1 beauty in Haifang,

904
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.180
as well as the most popular girl
in our Shuiyan House.

905
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.660
Miss Shui.

906
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.580
(Miss Shui)

907
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:09.140
Nice to meet you.

908
00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.020
Miss Shui,

909
00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.380
I brought something

910
00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.660
especially for you today.

911
00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:19.260
This is called Feiwan Face Cream,

912
00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:20.100
and I made it myself.

913
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:20.740
The main ingredient

914
00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:22.260
is handmade almond oil.

915
00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:26.660
Here.

916
00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.780
And I also put sweet-scented osmanthus,

917
00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:30.580
white poria, and royal jelly in it.

918
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.660
They are all top-grade.

919
00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:35.220
How do you like it?

920
00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.260
Very nice.

921
00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.500
But,

922
00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:42.620
should I address you sir,

923
00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.980
or miss?

924
00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:46.780
Well…

925
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.060
Alright, I'll be honest with you.

926
00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:54.220
Actually, I…

927
00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.620
I'm just like you.

928
00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.820
I'm also a pretty girl.

929
00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.620
I like the perfume you are wearing.

930
00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.980
That's how you found out?

931
00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:04.860
If you like it,

932
00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:05.820
I made the perfume myself.

933
00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:06.820
I can give you a bottle.

934
00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.460
No need.

935
00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.060
How much is the face cream?

936
00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.060
How could I let you pay?

937
00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.260
It'll hurt our friendship.

938
00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:12.860
It's a gift for you. Okay?

939
00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:14.020
I'll bring more next time,

940
00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.100
and you can all give it a try.

941
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:18.660
That's very generous of you.

942
00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.940
You are good at doing business.

943
00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:20.940
It's my pleasure.

944
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:21.660
And you know what?

945
00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:22.780
Aside from the face cream,

946
00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:23.620
my store also sells

947
00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.340
fresh aloe-based, heat-relieving

948
00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:25.980
sunscreen,

949
00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:27.540
honeysuckle ointment and such.

950
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:28.700
If you are interested,

951
00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:29.660
I can come…

952
00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.220
Come to your place

953
00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.580
and introduce my products to you.

954
00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:33.540
Sure.

955
00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:35.340
Please wait for me

956
00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:36.180
in Room Tingshui.

957
00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:37.020
I'll let Madam Wu

958
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.380
bring you some snacks.

959
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.780
I'll go find you

960
00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.500
after I get changed.

961
00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.300
Alright.

962
00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:46.940
See you.

963
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.060
Qingqing.

964
00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:51.980
Qingqing.

965
00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.780
Here's another letter from the capital.

966
00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.060
If you receive it again,

967
00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.860
just burn it directly.

968
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:02.020
Well,

969
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.660
this Mister Qian is so persistent.

970
00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.020
It's been so many years,

971
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.100
and he's still

972
00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.020
looking forward to your return.

973
00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.660
He's persistent

974
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.980
because he wants my medicine formula.

975
00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:13.140
I'm worth nothing more

976
00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:14.740
than that to him.

977
00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.700
That's his loss.

978
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.460
You are

979
00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.460
the most popular girl

980
00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:21.860
in our Shuiyan House now.

981
00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.380
Everybody in Haifang

982
00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.620
knows how famous

983
00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.140
you are.

984
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.380
Your voice and dance

985
00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.540
is worth much more than the formula.

986
00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:37.020
Nothing in this world

987
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:38.980
is worth more

988
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.660
than my formula.

989
00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.780
That's right.

990
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:44.500
Whatever you say.

991
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.300
Now, get changed.

992
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.260
Be good.

993
00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:01.220
Well, bro.

994
00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.100
Although we've robbed

995
00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.500
a lot of people,

996
00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:08.340
I still feel nervous since Chief

997
00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:09.460
asked us to rob

998
00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.140
Ship Guihai this time.

999
00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.140
What are you afraid of?

1000
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:13.660
I've told you

1001
00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:16.300
that Guihai Warrior isn't there.

1002
00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:17.940
Who are left on his ship?

1003
00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.100
Maids, cooks, and sailors.

1004
00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.260
What are you afraid of then?

1005
00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.180
I'm worried

1006
00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:27.100
that he'd take revenge on us.

1007
00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:28.660
Take revenge?

1008
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.980
Who would dare

1009
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.580
to mess with us in Haifang?

1010
00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.060
You are right.

1011
00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.180
Bro,

1012
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.300
even if we fail to rob

1013
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.580
Ship Guihai,

1014
00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:52.820
we still have Chief Shen

1015
00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:54.340
to back us up.

1016
00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.300
No matter if it's Guihai Warrior,

1017
00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.780
or South Sea Swordsman,

1018
00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:00.020
as long as he's in Haifang,

1019
00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:04.380
he must submit to the Dragon Gang.

1020
00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:16.260
Room Tingshui...

1021
00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:16.820
Bro,

1022
00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:18.620
if our robbery is successful…

1023
00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.620
Which room is Room Tingshui?

1024
00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.780
Could you help me…

1025
00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:22.660
Is it here?

1026
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.220
...get a few

1027
00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:26.060
dancers from here?

1028
00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.380
Sir,

1029
00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:38.660
who are you looking for?

1030
00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.940
This is not Room Tingshui, isn't it?

1031
00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.980
I… I'm looking for Miss Shui.

1032
00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:52.860
It's the wrong room.

1033
00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:53.980
Wrong room.

1034
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:54.980
Hold it.

1035
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:00.780
What did you hear just now?

1036
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:06.500
Nothing.

1037
00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.300
I didn't hear anything.

1038
00:41:11.060 --> 00:41:12.500
Really, I heard nothing.

1039
00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:13.660
Seriously.

1040
00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.780
I didn't hear anything.

1041
00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.180
Go on. You guys keep talking.

1042
00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.820
Go on. Go on.

1043
00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.940
What did I hear?

1044
00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.060
Bro,

1045
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.380
he really didn't hear anything

1046
00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:35.700
or he was pretending that he didn't?

1047
00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.860
No matter he did or did not,

1048
00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:41.620
I have

1049
00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.260
to take it that he did just in case.

1050
00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.300
What a shame.

1051
00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.980
We've got to find that guy

1052
00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:03.780
and kill him.

1053
00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:08.500
