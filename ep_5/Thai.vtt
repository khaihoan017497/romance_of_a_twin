=Romance of a Twin Flower=

2
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.980
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.850
Listen.

4
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.800
The reason why

5
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.960
I fed you horse's manure,

6
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.410
tied your hands

7
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.600
and pried your mouth
with a bamboo ruler

8
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.690
is to feed you medicine.

9
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.410
Piss off.

10
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.010
What's wrong with you?

11
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.690
Get out!

12
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.160
Your Lordship.

13
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.210
You asked me out?
But I was trying to save you!

14
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.850
Your Lordship.

15
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.050
Gui Bai.

16
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.290
Your Lordship.

17
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.440
I finally found you.

18
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.760
Your injury...

19
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.370
Don't worry. He won't die.

20
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.810
What's the matter

21
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:19.600
with you?

22
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.850
When I came back from
dispensing the medicine last night,

23
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.970
I was ambushed by

24
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.420
a group of people in nocturnal clothing.

25
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.160
These men are fierce

26
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.160
and armed.

27
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.720
All my taels

28
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.440
and medicinal materials

29
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:30.760
were taken away.

30
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.010
They even beat you?

31
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.920
That must be

32
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.320
a group of powerful robbers.

33
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.570
Your Ladyship, you are right.

34
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.320
I will do my best

35
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.810
to investigate this matter.

36
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.480
I don't want anyone

37
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.410
to know about my injury.

38
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.320
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.760
It must be because of your guilty deeds

40
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.880
that you are afraid that others
will find out.

41
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.370
Nie Sangyu!

42
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.530
Don't worry.

43
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.640
I will keep it secret.

44
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.720
Find a doctor to ask

45
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.250
if there is anything wrong

46
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.600
with the medicine she fed me.

47
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.480
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.600
Inform everyone in the Mansion
to stay in their rooms.

49
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.880
Help me back to the bedroom.

50
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.290
Got it.

51
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.690
Your Lordship.

52
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.920
Why don't you go back

53
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.130
to your bedroom

54
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.600
when you feel better?

55
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.090
I am so unlucky

56
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.410
to have to take care of him.

57
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.020
Your Ladyship, Miss Wen is coming.

58
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.810
Miss Wen.

59
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.530
Your Ladyship.

60
00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.090
Why are you here today?

61
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.200
You didn't escape yesterday,

62
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.600
but you were caught

63
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:54.570
and scolded by His Lordship.

64
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.720
I'm worried about you,

65
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.250
so I've prepared some

66
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.530
dispassionate delicacies for you.

67
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.010
Tanxiang.

68
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.410
Send them to Her Ladyship.

69
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.040
No need.

70
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.010
Well...

71
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.280
My room

72
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.480
is a mess.

73
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.250
So embarrassing.

74
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.880
Miss Wen.

75
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.050
I have a cold today

76
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.760
and can't stay outside.

77
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.130
Miss Wen.

78
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.080
Let's get in.

79
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.810
Okay.

80
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.730
My room is very cold,

81
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.690
especially not suitable

82
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.810
for someone as weak as you.

83
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.200
You'll get worse.

84
00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.200
Muxu.

85
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.690
Let's just accept

86
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.640
her kindness.

87
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.280
I prepared millet rice.

88
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.280
Millet rice can
clear and nourish the stomach.

89
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.320
You are usually impatient

90
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.280
and have a bad temper.

91
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.880
It can relieve internal heat.

92
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.520
Bitter melon and lotus seeds

93
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.570
can remove the poison

94
00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.200
in the body.

95
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:02.520
Miss Wen.

96
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.840
Your Ladyship.

97
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.400
You'd better let

98
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.010
Miss Wen in.

99
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.400
Miss Wen

100
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.730
came to see you in person,

101
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.250
but she couldn't even drink tea.

102
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.080
Could it be that

103
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.490
there is something shady

104
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.080
hidden in

105
00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.400
Your Ladyship's room?

106
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.170
Tanxiang.

107
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.960
Watch your words.

108
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.130
Hurry up and send the things

109
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.520
to Her Ladyship's room.

110
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.130
And then we'll leave.

111
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:27.050
Well...

112
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:29.280
Well...

113
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.440
All right.

114
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.840
(Stop.)

115
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.250
Your Lordship.

116
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.610
(Leave here.)

117
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.050
He... He's here.

118
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.200
It's not because...

119
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.130
It's not because of me...

120
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.730
He...

121
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.320
He...

122
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.250
Tanxiang, let's go.

123
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.840
Thank you.

124
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.980
(Virtue Prevails)

125
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.490
It looks like you've recovered enough

126
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.960
to sit up.

127
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.690
If you feel better,

128
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:24.840
go back.

129
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.640
After all, you also heard

130
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.570
that Miss Wen came just now.

131
00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.610
If you continue to live here,

132
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.960
everyone in the Mansion

133
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.080
will probably know about it.

134
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.440
After the commotion just now,

135
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.740
many people in the Mansion

136
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.540
will keep an eye on this place.

137
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.940
I can't go back for a while.

138
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:40.660
What?

139
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.420
Your Lordship.

140
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.980
Are you going to...

141
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.180
Your meal.

142
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.100
Put it there.

143
00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:53.180
Your Ladyship.

144
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.740
What are you doing?

145
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:54.740
Where to put it?

146
00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:56.100
Where is the table?

147
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.100
I gave it away.

148
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:04.860
What about other things?

149
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.980
All given away.

150
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.420
Nie Sangyu.

151
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.100
Good for you.

152
00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.980
Your Lordship, can't you

153
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.390
endure hardship in Reflection Pavilion?

154
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.660
Then you should leave.

155
00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.420
Who said that I have to
endure hardship?

156
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.700
(Reflection Pavilion)

157
00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:31.300
Here.

158
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.300
Take care.

159
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.860
Move this over.

160
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.620
Take care.

161
00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.300
Here. Okay.

162
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.300
- Do me a favor.
- Take care.

163
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:37.940
Okay.

164
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.100
Hurry up.

165
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.780
There are still many things to move.

166
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.340
- Yes.
- Yes.

167
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.540
Is Her Ladyship being favored again?

168
00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:08.780
Right.

169
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.180
Great.

170
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.740
Ning Yuxuan.

171
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.780
How dare you furnish
my room like this?

172
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:28.100
Ning Yuxuan.

173
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.380
Why did you

174
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.380
arrange my room like this?

175
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.380
I don't like this style.

176
00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.660
Strong objection.

177
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:38.820
Objection overruled.

178
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:41.260
I'm not here to reflect on myself.

179
00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.660
Why don't I live comfortably?

180
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.180
I know

181
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.020
you want to stay here

182
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.180
for a long time.

183
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.900
You are taking over my place.

184
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:51.660
Understand?

185
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:53.180
You'd better stop talking.

186
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:54.780
Or you will be kicked out in a while.

187
00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:58.300
Stop talking?

188
00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.060
This is my room.

189
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.180
Remember?

190
00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.660
Let me remind you.

191
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:04.060
The whole mansion is mine.

192
00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.140
Why didn't these people

193
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.140
stab you to death?

194
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.180
I attract resentment in the Mansion.

195
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.820
But why have you been assassinated

196
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:31.780
again and again?

197
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.300
I know it happened

198
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.060
more than three times.

199
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:33.660
Could it be that

200
00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:34.700
you are not a good officer?

201
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:35.260
Gui Bai.

202
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.940
Get her out of here.

203
00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:38.420
I...

204
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.180
Hold on.

205
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:50.460
I will shut up

206
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:56.780
and eat meat.

207
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:07.940
Miss Wen.

208
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.180
You haven't eaten all day.

209
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:13.260
Eat something.

210
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.460
Or

211
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.780
your stomachache will strike again.

212
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:20.460
Has His Lordship ever left
Reflection Pavilion?

213
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.180
No.

214
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:44.940
What are you looking at?

215
00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:13.780
You can't see anything.

216
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:39.420
Wait, Ning Yuxuan.

217
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.780
Here is my room.

218
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.420
Why do you sleep on the bed
but I sleep on the couch?

219
00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.460
I...

220
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.180
Listen.

221
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.060
Don't peek at me

222
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.060
after I fall asleep in a while.

223
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.140
I know the medicine smells strange.

224
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.660
But it works well on stopping bleeding.

225
00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:36.780
How do you know about prescribing?

226
00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:37.460
I...

227
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.260
I don't know.

228
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.020
I only knew

229
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:41.700
that I thought of this prescription

230
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.900
the moment I saw your injury,

231
00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:44.060
and its taste

232
00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:44.820
is right.

233
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.940
Take it.

234
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.660
(Why can she heal?)

235
00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.140
What are you doing?

236
00:12:59.140 --> 00:12:59.940
Your Ladyship, you...

237
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:00.780
What knot are you tying?

238
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.180
Sailor's Knot.

239
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:03.580
Sailor's Knot?

240
00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.180
(Sailor's Knot...)

241
00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.660
(Is he coming over?)

242
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:41.540
(If he goes one step further,)

243
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:43.180
(don't blame me for being rude.)

244
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:44.820
(Nie Sangyu.)

245
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.460
(Why did you change so much?)

246
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.060
(I didn't expect him)

247
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.260
(to go back.)

248
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:30.420
Your Highness.

249
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.020
Yesterday the Emperor

250
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.940
gave Ning Yuxuan a big reward

251
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:36.820
in front of me

252
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.780
for governing the flood
in the Southeast.

253
00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.020
It's a pity that

254
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:43.180
Ning Yuxuan had a good relationship
with the Emperor

255
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.540
and they colluded with each other.

256
00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:46.540
Otherwise, do you think

257
00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:48.060
I will settle for second best

258
00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.700
and choose you, a piece of trash?

259
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.820
Your Highness, thank you
for your appreciation.

260
00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.380
I will do my best

261
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.420
to live up to your expectations.

262
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.940
(Lord Tan)

263
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.420
What's the use of a dog

264
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.540
if it doesn't bite?

265
00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:20.540
No matter what method you use,

266
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.020
if you can't beat Ning Yuxuan

267
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.140
and get the position of prime minister,

268
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.540
everything you enjoy now,

269
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.420
including your life,

270
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.700
will be wiped out in an instant.

271
00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.060
I got it.

272
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.420
Thank you for your suggestion.

273
00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.020
I will find a countermeasure

274
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:49.180
to bring down Ning Yuxuan
as soon as possible.

275
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:12.420
Yuxuan, tell me

276
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:13.700
what you want.

277
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.650
I will buy it for you.

278
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:17.780
I want to

279
00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.420
(Ning Yuxuan (Teenage))

280
00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:20.420
construct spiritual values
for the society,

281
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.780
endow people with meaning in life,

282
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.540
inherit and carry forward the knowledge
of the sages that is about to disappear,

283
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.060
and open up a foundation
of eternal peace for all generations.

284
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.540
(Ning Zhongtian)

285
00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:28.420
Good ambition.

286
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.820
You are worthy of being my son.

287
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:31.580
Dad.

288
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:32.420
When I grow up,

289
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.940
I will be a man of indomitable spirit

290
00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.140
like you.

291
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.420
Dad. Go!

292
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:45.140
Someone help me!

293
00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:47.780
Help!

294
00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:50.180
Help!

295
00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.940
Dad!

296
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.140
Ning Yuxuan!

297
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:10.140
Ning Yuxuan!

298
00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.500
Is the wound...

299
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.380
No!

300
00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.620
Dad.

301
00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:17.860
- Dad.
- It hurts!

302
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:18.740
It hurts!

303
00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:22.180
No!

304
00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:23.220
You are having a nightmare.

305
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:24.980
Wake up.

306
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.380
Ning Yuxuan!

307
00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:30.460
No, I have to wake you up.

308
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.260
Dad!

309
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:31.820
Sorry.

310
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.980
Dad!

311
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:38.860
You woke up.

312
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.420
You just had...

313
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.260
What are you doing?

314
00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.620
You just had a nightmare.

315
00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.940
So I woke you up.

316
00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.620
What's wrong with you?

317
00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.340
Does your wound hurt?

318
00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.180
No.

319
00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:17.500
Let me see.

320
00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.460
Get away.

321
00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.380
Let me see.

322
00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:19.940
Get away.

323
00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:20.620
I said let me see your wound.

324
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.420
Your Lordship. Your Lordship.

325
00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:35.460
No...

326
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.700
No need to say anything.

327
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.500
I am leaving.

328
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.380
Congratulations, Your Ladyship.

329
00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.180
What's up?

330
00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.260
Last night was the first time

331
00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:55.260
that His Lordship stayed with you

332
00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.530
in the four years

333
00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.460
since you married him.

334
00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.460
But nothing happened.

335
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.180
I don't

336
00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:03.420
want him here at all.

337
00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:07.900
May I come over?

338
00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.660
Turn around.

339
00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:12.940
Your Lordship.

340
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.180
Why is what you say
and what you do

341
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.340
never the same?

342
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.660
I... I...

343
00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:30.420
Have those who attacked you that day

344
00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:32.180
been tracked down?

345
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.580
I have already checked.

346
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.380
Although those I killed

347
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.980
were all dressed as bandits,

348
00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.100
they didn't have totems on their arms,

349
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.380
and their clothes didn't
look like bandits,

350
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:41.940
but like...

351
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:42.980
Like what?

352
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.700
They seem to be trained
by the government.

353
00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.820
Ling Jianxing

354
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.180
is very well informed.

355
00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.020
He can never know that

356
00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.220
I am hurt.

357
00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:57.860
Yes, sir.

358
00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.860
Only Her Ladyship and Muxu

359
00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:00.660
know about your injury.

360
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:03.940
Is there a problem with the prescription?

361
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.660
I showed the doctor

362
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.660
the prescription from Her Ladyship yesterday.

363
00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:08.820
There's no problem,

364
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.380
instead...

365
00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.220
Instead what?

366
00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.860
The doctor said the prescription is good.

367
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:19.340
The prescription...

368
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.620
Is good.

369
00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.260
Good?

370
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:25.820
Leave me alone.

371
00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:35.940
Go.

372
00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:41.420
Well...

373
00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.620
Put it there. Go.

374
00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:57.500
The prescription is good?

375
00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.140
I'll have to see what new face creams

376
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.140
we can make

377
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:03.260
besides the Scar Recovering Cream.

378
00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:04.860
Otherwise,

379
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.900
it is far from enough

380
00:21:07.020 --> 00:21:08.700
to make money
from Scar Recovery Cream alone.

381
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.340
Your Ladyship, but the relationship

382
00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:12.420
between you and His Lordship

383
00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.420
has eased.

384
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.460
Why are you still making money?

385
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.460
Look.

386
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:23.940
I have only been awake
for a few days,

387
00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.180
and he has been assassinated three times.

388
00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:28.380
He has so many enemies.

389
00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:30.380
So

390
00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.620
men are unreliable.

391
00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:35.980
We have to rely on ourselves.

His Lordship is watching you.

406
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:05.180

but peeking at me behind my back.

410
00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:21.460

416
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:48.940
I thought of a way

417
00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.460
we could get out.

418
00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:51.980
How?

419
00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.020
Your Lordship.

420
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.380
Time to apply medicine.

421
00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:04.100
This is the Peony Scar Recovering Cream

422
00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.740
that I specially developed for you

423
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:06.180
to remove scars.

424
00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.420
Take off your socks now.

425
00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.620
Take off my socks?

426
00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:11.020
Right.

427
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:12.900
What's the problem?

428
00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.180
Take it away. I don't need it.

429
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.790
Are you shy because

430
00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.160
you just peeked at me?

431
00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.420
Who peeked at you?

432
00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.500
You!

433
00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.700
What are you afraid of?

434
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:32.940
We know each other well.

435
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:35.660
This is Peony Scar Recovering Cream

436
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:37.020

This...

442
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.380
This is the best.

443
00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:49.180
This is for the soles of the feet.

444
00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:51.700
For the

445
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:53.660
soles of the feet?

446
00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:55.500
Right.

447
00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:57.420
Come on.

448
00:24:59.340 --> 00:24:59.940
Wait, what are you...

449
00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:01.460
Come on, take off your socks.

450
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.500
No, wait.

451
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:05.380
Why do I have to take off my socks?

452
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:07.220
I'm going to apply medicine to you.

453
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:07.660
I...

454
00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.700
Who promised you to
apply medicine to me?

455
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:11.340
Good boy.

456
00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:12.700
I will be gentle.

457
00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:13.980
Come on.

458
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.620
Hurry up.

459
00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:16.420
Don't touch me.

460
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:16.980
Hurry up.

461
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:17.740
Listen, don't touch me.

462
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.940
Hurry up.

463
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.220
(Reflection Pavilion)

464
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.140
Miss Wen.

465
00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:30.580
I'm here to greet His Lordship.

466
00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:31.860
Go inform him.

467
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.420
I'm afraid it's not the right time.

468
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.940
Her Ladyship is having fun
with His Lordship.

469
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:38.700
You'd better not disturb them.

470
00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:39.420
What?

471
00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:40.050
Are you trying to

472
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.260
stop Her Ladyship?

473
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.180
If you aren't afraid of
being reprimanded,

474
00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.140
please go ahead.

475
00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:45.940
(Ning Yuxuan.)

476
00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:46.940
(Don't touch me.)

477
00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.420
(Take off the socks.)

478
00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:50.660
(Don't dawdle here.)

479
00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:50.980
(Hurry up.)

480
00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.740
(Don't touch me.)

481
00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.940
(Come on, I am applying you the medicine.)

482
00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:54.940
(Hurry up.)

483
00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.100
(Don't touch me.)

484
00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:57.700
(What's up?)

485
00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.140
Forget it.

486
00:25:59.460 --> 00:25:59.930
(Take them off.)

487
00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.620
(Stop it.)

488
00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:03.140
- Listen, don't touch me.
- Hurry up.

489
00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:03.980
Come on. Take a try.

490
00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:04.220
Nie Sangyu.

491
00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:05.100
Nie Sangyu.

492
00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:05.530
Take a try.

493
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.410
Piss off.

494
00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:08.940
What did you say?

495
00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.020
Say that again.

496
00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:13.340
I said

497
00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:16.940
please stay away from me,

498
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:17.660
thank you.

499
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.940
That's what you said.

500
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:20.820
I just want to

501
00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:21.940
visit the flower market today.

502
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:24.660
Since you said so,

503
00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:26.180
I have no choice but to go there

504
00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:27.620
so as not to hinder you.

505
00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.100
Your Ladyship, good for you.

506
00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:46.940
You thought of going out

507
00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:47.940
this way.

508
00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.940
This is called doing exactly the opposite.

509
00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:50.860
Muxu.

510
00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:51.860
Do you find any special

511
00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:53.940
about this street?

512
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:55.940
Nothing special.

513
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.940
Miss, take a look.

514
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.460
All homemade.

515
00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.140
Take a look.

516
00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.180
Sir.

517
00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:04.380
I would like to ask

518
00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.340
if there is

519
00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:06.580
any cosmetic shop in this market.

520
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:07.660
There used to be one.

521
00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:08.660
But later it closed.

522
00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.740
And there is no more.

523
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:12.620
Thank you.

524
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:13.260
You are welcome.

525
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:13.860
Thank you.

526
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:14.740
You are welcome.

527
00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.980
Muxu, see?

528
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.180
The taels

529
00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:22.140
are already beckoning to us.

530
00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:23.180
What taels?

531
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:24.940
Cosmetic business.

532
00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:26.140
Let's go.

533
00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:27.140
Cosmetic business?

534
00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:28.140
Your Ladyship.

535
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.940
Nie Sangyu

536
00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:30.940
hasn't come back yet?

537
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.460
Your Lordship, didn't you

538
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.220
kick her out?

539
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:36.860
Things are different now.

540
00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.420
Nie Sangyu

541
00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.340
is full of doubts now.

542
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.420
Get her back now.

543
00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.220
Why are you wanting Her Ladyship back
in such a hurry?

544
00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.260
I...

545
00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:52.020
I want her to change my medicine.

546
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:53.180
Yes, sir.

547
00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:02.220
Look.

548
00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.340
Slowly and gently

549
00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:05.500
apply this face cream

550
00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:07.620
- to the wound.
- Here?

551
00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.660
Once every morning and evening.

552
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:10.460
- I promise that
- Here, take a look.

553
00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.180
it will take effect

554
00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:11.940
- within seven days.
- This is the face cream.

555
00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:12.660
Really?

556
00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:12.980
Yes.

557
00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:13.700
One for me.

558
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:15.380
Okay.

559
00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:16.900
Thank you.

560
00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:18.250
Bye.

561
00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:18.770
- Boss.
- Would you like to try?

562
00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.380
Isn't this the First Lady
of the Ning's Mansion?

563
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.580
We finally found her.

564
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.580
I will go grab her.

565
00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:24.660
You should go back first.

566
00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.100
Boss.

567
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:29.380
Go.

568
00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:30.020
This...

569
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:32.420
Look, rub it gently like this.

570
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:34.940
It works better.

571
00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.260
Sir, you must be a good man

572
00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:37.580
to buy the face cream for your wife.

573
00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:39.940
I am not married.

574
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:40.740
I just feel that

575
00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.460
the face cream has a unique aroma,

576
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.940
and it's the first time I've seen it
in the capital.

577
00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:49.460
You have good taste.

578
00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.020
I have a lot of new products here.

579
00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:51.820
Take a look.

580
00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:52.740
Look, this one.

581
00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:53.700
Smell it.

582
00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.700
Look at this.

583
00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.740
This is for soothing.

584
00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:58.220
And

585
00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.180
this is for moisturizing.

586
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.020
Right.

587
00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.620
And for whitening.

588
00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:03.860
Like this one.

589
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:04.980
Each one

590
00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.100
has a different effect.

591
00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:06.740
Look.

592
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.660
Take a try.

593
00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:08.860
This is for scar recovering.

594
00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:09.940
And look at this.

595
00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:10.980
For moisturizing.

596
00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:12.380
If you use this...

597
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:13.940
Miss, look.

598
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.500
The face cream is not the same color

599
00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:18.900
as my hand.

600
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.660
Sir.

601
00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:30.100
You really don't understand.

602
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.660
No face cream

603
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.980
is the same as skin color.

604
00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:35.940
(As rumored,)

605
00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:37.340
(she has lost all memory,)

606
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.100
(and she doesn't even remember)

607
00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:39.820
(the logo of the Tea Gang.)

608
00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.380
For example,

609
00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:40.940
when your skin

610
00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:41.900
is itchy

611
00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.140
or allergic,

612
00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:43.860
applying it

613
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:44.860
can have

614
00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:45.900
a soothing effect.

615
00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:46.340
Good.

616
00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:49.020
Miss, it's a pity that

617
00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.980
such a good business is only used to
set up a street stall.

618
00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.220
It won't be just a street stall.

619
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:53.740
I'm going to open
a cosmetic shop.

620
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.660
I want to open the shops

621
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.180
all over the world

622
00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.180
and

623
00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.660
make all the girls beautiful.

624
00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:02.820
You are so ambitious.

625
00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:04.940
How vast is the world.

626
00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.420
It's really not enough

627
00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:07.820
in this one place.

628
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:10.220
I am Yuan Lang,

629
00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.180
a wandering businessman.

630
00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:13.100
I'm looking for business
opportunities everywhere.

631
00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:15.340
How about you ship,

632
00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:15.980
I pay,

633
00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:17.420
and we cooperate?

634
00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:20.580
Cooperate?

635
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:22.740
Sir.

636
00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.460
We met for the first time today,

637
00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.980
and you come to me

638
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.580
for cooperation.

639
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.240
Your Ladyship...

640
00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:28.940
Isn't it a bit of...

641
00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:29.380
Gui Bai.

642
00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.180
Gui Bai.

643
00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.220
Gui Bai?

644
00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:36.900
Why is he coming?

645
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.580
He's everywhere.

646
00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:42.940
Didn't he see that
I am making money?

647
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:43.340
Miss.

648
00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.660
I have something else to do

649
00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:45.460
and I have to go.

650
00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.740
This is my sincerity.

651
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:49.220
If you are interested in cooperation,

652
00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.660
feel free to come to Wanghua Restaurant
to find me.

653
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.180
Hold on.

654
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:55.580
Sir.

655
00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:56.940
I got your sincerity.

656
00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:57.980
But I can't

657
00:30:59.140 --> 00:30:59.820
take the money.

658
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:00.940
See you again.

659
00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:02.940
Okay, see you another day.

660
00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:10.980
Your Ladyship.

661
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.180
Your Ladyship, you...

662
00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:21.420
Don't you see I'm making money?

663
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.250
His Lordship asks you to
return home immediately.

664
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:23.980
For what?

665
00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:25.220
Change the medicine.

666
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:26.900
Change the medicine?

667
00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:29.100
Lackey Ning is so funny that

668
00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:31.180
he let his wife come out to set up a stall.

669
00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.420
Boss.

670
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:33.940
No one is allowed to

671
00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:34.700
disturb her in the future.

672
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:35.740
Wait, Boss...

673
00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.260
This is an order.

674
00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.220
Your wound is fine,
why do you need to change the medicine?

675
00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.820
Why are you in such a hurry
to get me back?

676
00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.860
Did you miss me?

677
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:03.620
No way.

678
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:16.980
Look at you.

679
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.380
You are the First Lady
of the Marquis's Mansion.

680
00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.460
Who will you embarrass

681
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:22.700
by setting up a stall in the street?

682
00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:25.140
Who did I embarrass?

683
00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:27.900
Is it wrong for me

684
00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.500
to earn my own money?

685
00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:33.180
Besides,

686
00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:34.860
I have already filed

687
00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:35.860
for divorce with you.

688
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:37.380
I'm not your wife anymore.

689
00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.620
Nie Sangyu.

690
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:40.940
I don't understand

691
00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:41.820
why you make

692
00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:43.220
so much money?

693
00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.740
Every penny I make right now

694
00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.100
is for leaving you in a better way.

695
00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:00.420
You!

696
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:02.180
I've already thought about it.

697
00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.100
I have no memory

698
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.260
since I fell from a high place.

699
00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.420
I narrowly escaped death,

700
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.700
which can be considered a new life.

701
00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:10.980
I don't know

702
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:12.740
if your amnesia this time

703
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.900
is a blessing or a curse to me.

704
00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:16.940
So

705
00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:18.660
for you and me,

706
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.100
the best ending

707
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.220
is us to be separated from each other

708
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.340
and live on our own.

709
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:30.740
I am now formally notifying you that

710
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:32.180
I will leave after your injury recovers.

711
00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:01.740
What did you find out
from the Ning's Mansion?

712
00:34:02.460 --> 00:34:03.260
According to reports from spies,

713
00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.580
Ning Yuxuan seemed to have had a cold.

714
00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.020
He stayed with the First Lady

715
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:07.900
last night.

716
00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.580
Everything else is normal.

717
00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.420
This woman is notorious

718
00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.220
for being brutal and unreasonable.

719
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:16.620
How could Ning Yuxuan

720
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:17.780
let her serve him for so long?

721
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:19.460
It's not normal at all.

722
00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:21.860
If it was just medicine for a cold,

723
00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.420
they wouldn't have been in such a hurry.

724
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:31.500
Ning Yuxuan.

725
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.300
You must be injured

726
00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:38.940
and hiding at home recuperating.

727
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.300
Sorry for my incompetence.

728
00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:45.140
Keep investigating.

729
00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:47.500
Yes, sir.

730
00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.420
(Huixian Pavilion)
Muxu.

731
00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.500
I like it.

732
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:00.420
Your Ladyship, let's go back.

733
00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:01.900
We slipped out for too long today.

734
00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:02.540
After a while, His Lordship

735
00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:03.940
will send Gui Bai to arrest us again.

736
00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.500
What a coward.

737
00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.060
I'm excited about the shop.

738
00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:09.420
Here.

739
00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.300
This is the place to put shelves.

740
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:11.940
Your Ladyship.

741
00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.820
Do you really want
to divorce His Lordship?

742
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:15.460
I have to.

743
00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:17.980
All I have in mind right now
is the business opportunity.

744
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:19.740
- Your Ladyship.
- Here.

745
00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:21.420
You have changed so much

746
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:23.500
that I still can't believe it now.

747
00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.540
And more of them here.

748
00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:26.300
One, two, three, four.

749
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:27.780
Madame, are you here for the shop?

750
00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:30.820
Are you the owner?

751
00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:32.820
Yes.

752
00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.980
What do you think of here?

753
00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:38.140
Pretty good.

754
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.740
How much will it cost?

755
00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:40.980
This shop

756
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:42.300
is a treasured place.

757
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.940
If you really want it,

758
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.460
I'll give you a discounted price.

759
00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:46.260
Please.

760
00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:48.740
How is it?

761
00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:50.980
Eighty taels?

762
00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.020
One...

763
00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:00.740
One hundred and eighty taels?

764
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:03.300
Eight hundred taels!

765
00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:04.380
Eight hundred taels?

766
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.340
Cash only.

767
00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.420
It's too expensive.

768
00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.620
It's indeed expensive.

769
00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.620
But this shop

770
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.740
is in the central area.

771
00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:11.940
There is a reason why it's expensive.

772
00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:12.860
Sir.

773
00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:14.860
I've been here for a long time.

774
00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.140
I really want to rent here.

775
00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:16.980
How about

776
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.580
giving me a discount?

777
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:25.300
Now that you really want it,

778
00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:26.860
tell me your quotation.

779
00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.580
My quotation.

780
00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.500
Let me think.

781
00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:36.380
How much do you have?

782
00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:37.780
Eighty taels.

783
00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:44.260
(Bank notes)

784
00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:53.500
I think everything is fine.

785
00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:55.100
But there are also

786
00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.060
some disadvantages.

787
00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:56.700
Well.

788
00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:57.860
I think...

789
00:36:58.260 --> 00:36:58.860
This price.

790
00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.940
Piss off.

791
00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:02.940
(Never come again without money!)

792
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.140
Even if I have money,

793
00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:08.060
I won't rent here!

794
00:37:10.980 --> 00:37:11.540
Your Ladyship.

795
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.820
How about we go back now?

796
00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:14.380
No way.

797
00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:15.540
I'm going to take another look.

798
00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.060
Maybe

799
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.140
there really is a shop with
a monthly rent of eighty taels.

800
00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:20.540
This...

801
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.540
Wish Your Majesty good health.

802
00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:36.820
Wish the country prosperity.

803
00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:51.620
Long live Your Majesty.

804
00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:56.500
Please rise.

805
00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.740
Thank you, Your Majesty.

806
00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:03.820
What?

807
00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.140
Hasn't Consul Ning gone to court yet?

808
00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:09.860
Your Majesty.

809
00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.700
Mr. Ning caught a cold

810
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.060
and is not yet healed.

811
00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.100
It is inconvenient for him to go out.

812
00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:19.980
Let the Imperial Hospital

813
00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:21.620
prepare some high-quality
medicinal materials

814
00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.740
and send them to Consul Ning's mansion

815
00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.300
to show comfort.

816
00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.580
Yes.

817
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.340
Your Majesty.

818
00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.940
The Longxiang Army won a battle
with the enemy

819
00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:33.980
in the early summer of this year,

820
00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.100
killing more than 3,000 people.

821
00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.700
It is really a matter
of great joy to our country.

822
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.340
I would like to ask Your Majesty

823
00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:42.980
to reward them.

824
00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:46.900
Sure.

825
00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.340
A great reward for them.

826
00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:50.300
Well.

827
00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:51.580
I decide to

828
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.700
hold a flower fair
in the Imperial Garden

829
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:55.940
to reward these

830
00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:56.980
meritorious officials.

831
00:38:57.380 --> 00:38:59.500
You can bring your
family members along

832
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.940
to attend.

833
00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:02.900
This is a rare opportunity for us

834
00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.140
to have fun together.

835
00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

836
00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:08.740
Your Majesty.

837
00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:10.940
The Longxiang Army
relied on Consul Ning

838
00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.500
to transport army provisions and weapons

839
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.300
for this great victory.

840
00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:17.220
If Consul Ning were absent
from the ceremony,

841
00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:18.900
I am afraid that the soldiers

842
00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.020
of the Longxiang Army would be sad.

843
00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:26.980
What you said makes sense.

844
00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:28.820
Pass my verbal order

845
00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:30.460
to inform him

846
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.220
to participate together by then.

847
00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:33.980
Aye.

848
00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:38.020
Tao.

849
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.580
Try the wine.

850
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.740
It's awesome.

851
00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.340
I don't want it.

852
00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:44.940
Eat the dishes.

853
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.020
I don't want it.

854
00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.300
You don't drink or eat.

855
00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.140
Why are you here?

856
00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.140
Why are you looking at me?

857
00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.980
Didn't you ask me here?

858
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.300
Do you think I would like to come?

859
00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:55.420
Just get to the point.

860
00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.700
Right.

861
00:39:58.940 --> 00:39:59.700
I almost forgot it.

862
00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:02.740
Well...

863
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.220
Do you understand

864
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:05.980
what Mr. Ling meant today

865
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:06.780
on the court?

866
00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:11.060
Ling Jianxing

867
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:12.940
insisted on letting Yuxuan participate
in the martial arts performance.

868
00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:15.060
But according to what he said,

869
00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:16.700
Yuxuan should participate.

870
00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:17.980
Then why didn't he mention it earlier,

871
00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:19.460
but only after

872
00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.420
His Majesty said

873
00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.560
we could bring our wives to participate?

874
00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.380
You mean

875
00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.500
he deliberately wanted Yuxuan

876
00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:26.660
to participate with his wife?

877
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.140
Which lady would he bring?

878
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.100
Can you finish the sentence

879
00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:31.140
in one sitting?

880
00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.060
Have you ever heard that

881
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.340
one can't make a big success
without being self-reliant?

882
00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.580
The position of consul

883
00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.460
is a big success.

884
00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:41.820
Although His Majesty

885
00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.060
didn't say it clearly,

886
00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:44.300
only the principal wives

887
00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:45.500
are eligible to participate

888
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:46.340
in this martial arts performance.

889
00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:47.300
Everyone knows that

890
00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.140
Yuxuan

891
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.500
is at odds with his wife.

892
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.300
If he makes a fool of himself
in public,

893
00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.340
Yuxuan

894
00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:55.380
would not only be embarrassed,

895
00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:57.340
but also lose his future.

896
00:40:58.060 --> 00:40:59.060
The position of prime minister.

897
00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.460
Why do I have to go?

898
00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:07.820
I am not going.

899
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.700
It's a deal.

900
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:10.370
Don't forget

901
00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.660
we are getting a divorce.

902
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:12.700
As long as we are not divorced yet,

903
00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:13.900
you are still the First Lady
of the Ning's Mansion.

904
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.380
You have to

905
00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.420
do your job.

906
00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:19.980
Why can't others be there?

907
00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:20.980
No way.

908
00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.580
Why?

909
00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:22.580
Miss Wen

910
00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.460
can also perform her duties.

911
00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:24.620
All the important ministers in the court

912
00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.660
will bring their principal wives

913
00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:26.820
to attend the Flower Fair
in the Imperial Garden.

914
00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.540
I only have you as my principal wife.

915
00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.420
If I bring my concubine to attend,

916
00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.580
others will think that
I don't care about the principal wife.

917
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:33.100
How much trouble do you want
to cause me?

918
00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.020
Easy.

919
00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.220
I will divorce you today.

920
00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:37.300
It is reasonable for you

921
00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:38.020
to attend tomorrow with Wen Wan.

922
00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:46.180
Nie Sangyu.

923
00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:48.980
Are you looking down on the position

924
00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.300
of the principal wife
of the Marquis's Mansion so much?

925
00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:53.420
I don't dare to.

926
00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.900
The clothes are here.

927
00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.780
Try them on when you have time.

928
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.140
If it doesn't fit you,

929
00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.500
I'll ask someone to fix it.

930
00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.180
No way.

931
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.340
If you go this time,

932
00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:17.300
maybe I will agree

933
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.020
to divorce you.

934
00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:21.060
Really?

935
00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.700
Listen, Ning Yuxuan.

936
00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.380
Don't try to scare me.

937
00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.580
I've already made

938
00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:33.220
enough money.

939
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:34.700
Regardless of whether you agree
to divorce me or not,

940
00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:35.980
and whether you sign
the agreement or not,

941
00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.220
I will definitely leave the Ning's Mansion.

942
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.060
Do you know that

943
00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.500
if I don't sign this agreement,

944
00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:44.700
your money will be shared
by both of us?

945
00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.700
No matter how much money
you earn from opening a store,

946
00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:50.700
I can share half of it.

947
00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:57.860
Good for you.

948
00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.340
That's what you want.

949
00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:02.340
You...

950
00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.180
Think about it yourself.

951
00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.620
You went so far!

952
00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.980
You bad guy!

953
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:12.660
I'll compromise one last time.
