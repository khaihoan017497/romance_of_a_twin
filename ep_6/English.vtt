=Episode 6=

3
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.720
Mr. Ning.

4
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.210
Mr. Ning.

5
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.490
Mr. Ning.

6
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.010
Mr. Ning.

7
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.100
You know a lot of people here.

8
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:12.500
Mr. Ning.

9
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.660
Is this what the palace looks like?

10
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.380
It's grand.

11
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.820
Don't forget who you are

12
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.820
in front of His Majesty.

13
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.660
People don't know about your memory loss.

14
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.500
Just stay with me

15
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.340
and be careful with your words.

16
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.820
Don't blunder.

17
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.100
Do you understand?

18
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.420
Mr. Ning.

19
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.380
What kind of

20
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.220
relationship

21
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.940
should we pretend to have later?

22
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.220
For example, we can be affectionate,

23
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.820
or friendly in appearance
but estranged at heart,

24
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.060
or

25
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.420
we can act like enemies.

26
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.420
I can do either one.

27
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.340
Which one do you want?

28
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.700
Mr. Ning.

29
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.500
Mr. Ning.

30
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.060
Yuxuan.

31
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.100
I have something to ask you.

32
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.540
Never mind.

33
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.940
How come you have such good skin?

34
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.940
Yes, you have such fine skin.

35
00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.820
Look at

36
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.380
your pale and delicate skin.

37
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:25.260
I'm not like you.

38
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.660
My face is wrinkled.

39
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:27.820
- Not at all.
- It's not that bad.

40
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.780
Look, my skin is dark.

41
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.420
It does look worse.

42
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.380
Oh, no.

43
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.540
Sisters.

44
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.100
Mrs. Ning.

45
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.140
Hello, guys.

46
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.260
You all look good.

47
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.100
I wonder what kind of...

48
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.620
Sangyu.

49
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.260
You have the finest skin.

50
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.340
Who are you?

51
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.660
Look at her skin.

52
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.100
It's good by nature.

53
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.220
General Tao?

54
00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.260
Sangyu.

55
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.940
I arranged the banquet today.

56
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.220
How's it?

57
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.380
It's good.

58
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.540
I'm glad you like it.

59
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.100
I haven't finished yet.

60
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.500
What kind of face cream

61
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.780
do you use every day?

62
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.660
Sangyu, you should take your seat.

63
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.140
I have something to do here.

64
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.380
Just do what you got to do.

65
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.980
If you don't mind.

66
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.260
I would like to recommend

67
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.140
the face cream I use to you.

68
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.980
Look at my skin.

69
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.820
Isn't it pretty good?

70
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.500
Sangyu.

71
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.180
- The banquet is about to start.
- It works very well.

72
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.060
Let's go.

73
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:24.170
Come on.

74
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.740
Wait for me.

75
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.860
I'll be back later.

76
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.660
Okay?

77
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.220
Okay.

78
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.220
Make sure you wait for me.

79
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.220
Okay.

80
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.340
Sangyu.

81
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.300
I wonder what kind of face cream

82
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.300
Mrs. Ning is using.

83
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.660
Yes, it worked pretty well.

84
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.220
Sangyu, please.

85
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.540
You're a neat person.

86
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.580
I was afraid you wouldn't be used to it,

87
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.900
so I came here early

88
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.300
and cleaned it up.

89
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.900
Yuxuan is just like me.

90
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:48.860
As a man,

91
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.780
he doesn't care about such things.

92
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:51.340
Thank you.

93
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.660
What? Say it again.

94
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:09.420
General Tao.

95
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:11.420
Thank you.

96
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.220
Wait, are you thanking me?

97
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.740
Shouldn't I?

98
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:17.980
Of course not.

99
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.980
You're supposed to pick on me

100
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.860
for not cleaning it well

101
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.740
and for not doing it the way you want.

102
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.660
That's what you should do.

103
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:25.460
I don't think so.

104
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.780
You must be joking, General Tao.

105
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:27.900
No, I'm not joking.

106
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.740
It's just that you've always been
like this before.

107
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.340
Before?

108
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.100
What was I like before?

109
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.740
You never used to smile at me.

110
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.540
You'd just dismiss me, pick on me,

111
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.660
and even hit me when you had
a slight disagreement with me.

112
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:50.860
Have you forgotten all that?

113
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.420
We've been like this

114
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.740
since we first went to school together.

115
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:54.660
School?

116
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.220
Have I always been like this?

117
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.100
Yeah.

118
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.740
Let me think about it.

119
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.900
Do it.

120
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.900
I'll take my time to think about it.

121
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.540
(Is there something wrong)

122
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.980
(with this guy?)

123
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:14.980
(Why does he want to
be treated that way?)

124
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.340
Yes, I remember now.

125
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:20.220
That's true.

126
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.540
That's true.

127
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.880
I remember now. I...

128
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.660
No, no.

129
00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.660
You've changed.

130
00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.530
You're making me uncomfortable.

131
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.580
Is it because

132
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.540
Ning Yuxuan set rules for you

133
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.740
and that's why
you have your wings clipped?

134
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.540
We went to the same school.

135
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:33.340
You don't have to be so polite to me.

136
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.220
No, no.

137
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.180
It has nothing to do with him.

138
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.420
Maybe it's because I...

139
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.100
I've changed.

140
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.980
You've changed?

141
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.340
Yes.

142
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.540
Can you

143
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.780
change back

144
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.100
and hit me?

145
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.220
Or you can scold me.

146
00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:55.580
That's not necessary.

147
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:56.980
I can't do that.

148
00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.300
No, no, you can.

149
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.980
I can't.

150
00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.520
It's inappropriate.

151
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.220
It's very appropriate.

152
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.780
No, no.

153
00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:01.900
There is nothing inappropriate.

154
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.740
His Majesty

155
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.220
may be here any minute.

156
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.340
Why don't you go and greet him?

157
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.300
Otherwise, it would be impolite.

158
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.540
Well, Sangyu, have a seat first.

159
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.020
I'll see you later.

160
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.020
Okay.

161
00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.540
By the way, Qin.

162
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.420
There's one thing I don't understand.

163
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.780
A few days ago,

164
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.220
I took a few days off
because of typhoid fever.

165
00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.540
Why does His Majesty

166
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.340
insist that I must come?

167
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.420
The Longxiang Army won the battle.

168
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.460
His Majesty wants to reward
the meritorious officials.

169
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:29.900
Ling Jianxing specifically mentioned

170
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.220
that you should be present
with your wife.

171
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.340
You must be more careful.

172
00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.420
Consul Ling.

173
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.180
Here comes Lord Tan!

174
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:50.980
Mr. Ning.

175
00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.780
Mr. Ling.

176
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.660
Are you feeling better now?

177
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.980
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Ling.

178
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.340
I have recovered.

179
00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:58.740
Mr. Ling.

180
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.220
You should also take good care of yourself.

181
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.100
Please.

182
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.220
Please.

183
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.220
My dear, have a seat.

184
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.180
Here comes His Majesty!

185
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.540
(Beautiful Days and Nights
with Flowers and the Moon)

186
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.020
Greetings, Your Majesty.

187
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.900
You may rise.

188
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

189
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.420
Sit down.

190
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.660
Is he the Emperor?

191
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:11.940
Uncle.

192
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.620
Today I'm rewarding
the meritorious officials,

193
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:15.540
and you can

194
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:16.780
meet many of

195
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.660
your old brothers here.

196
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.660
I'm already an old man.

197
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.180
I'm afraid

198
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.060
they have forgotten me.

199
00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:28.420
Back then, our country was in turmoil.

200
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.620
The late emperor was seriously ill.

201
00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:31.140
Among all the Imperial Guards,

202
00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.500
we couldn't even gather

203
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.420
500 cavalrymen.

204
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:34.900
Things are different now.

205
00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.900
The army split up first
and then made a joint attack,

206
00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.300
and returned in triumph.

207
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.780
Your Majesty,

208
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.380
the world is all yours now.

209
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:55.180
Uncle, it was you who acted as regent
when our country was in danger

210
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:56.380
and reorganized the armies.

211
00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.780
When the enemy was bearing down in force,

212
00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.820
you took me on horseback

213
00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:01.020
to inspect the Imperial Guards.

214
00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.140
At that time,

215
00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.140
I didn't know how to ride a horse.

216
00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.540
The good thing is I learned it later,

217
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.660
so that I didn't have to

218
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.020
let someone control the reins.

219
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:13.420
Please sit down, Uncle.

220
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.380
You're also here, Marquis Moyu.

221
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.540
Yes, Your Majesty.

222
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.380
How is your health?

223
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.780
Thank you for your concern.

224
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:26.780
I have recovered.

225
00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.020
Have a seat.

226
00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.060
Everyone.

227
00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:31.900
Today is a day of celebration.

228
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.060
We'll share happiness together.

229
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.060
There is no need to be too formal.

230
00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:38.300
Let's begin.

231
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:40.900
Start the music

232
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.780
and the dance.

233
00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.180
This is a fruitful trip.

234
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:27.900
They are all my potential customers.

235
00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:29.540
Dear.

236
00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:31.660
Watch your manners.

237
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.380
What did I do?

238
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:36.940
Do I have to

239
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:37.780
sit here

240
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:38.500
like a stone?

241
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.540
My legs are a little sore.

242
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.660
Rub my legs.

243
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.300
We have to act like

244
00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:52.140
we're a lovely couple

245
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.660
in front of His Majesty.

246
00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.420
It's good for you

247
00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.300
to let others see

248
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.180
that we have a wonderful relationship.
You silly man.

249
00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.300
Hurry up.

250
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:01.940
Here.

251
00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:03.300
Right here.

252
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.020
Come on.

253
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.500
Right here.

254
00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.060
What are you doing?

255
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.020
Dear, remember,

256
00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.660
I won't be threatened by anyone.

257
00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.260
Mr. Ning, Mrs. Ning.

258
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.940
This is Mr. Ling.

259
00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.420
Nice to meet you.

260
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.540
It's rare to see you

261
00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.780
show up with Mrs. Ning.

262
00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.900
You must be in a good mood today.

263
00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:56.300
Yeah.

264
00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.540
No wonder.

265
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.660
No wonder what?

266
00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:03.900
I thought Mr. Ning would bring

267
00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.060
his newly married wife.

268
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.540
I didn't expect the First Lady

269
00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:09.780
to be so beautiful.

270
00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:12.820
I see.

271
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:16.260
Mr. Ning.

272
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.500
I heard that your newly married wife

273
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:19.900
is gentle and virtuous.

274
00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.140
You made us envious of you.

275
00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:27.900
Mr. Ling.

276
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.180
As the old saying goes,

277
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.380
one should raise a family first
before he governs the country.

278
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.380
You're not young anymore.

279
00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:36.660
You should think about

280
00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.660
finding yourself a wife.

281
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.540
No matter how beautiful
the women are in the brothel,

282
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.900
they're still passing clouds.

283
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.540
He looks like a decent man.

284
00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.780
Why is he so mean?

285
00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:58.260
Do you have a feud with him?

286
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:01.780
Do you?

287
00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:05.500
I see.

288
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.780
Did you steal his woman?

289
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:11.660
That must be the reason.

290
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:13.660
No wonder.

291
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.540
That's how he is

292
00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:16.300
at the school.

293
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:17.780
Just get used to it.

294
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.660
Is he your schoolmate?

295
00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:21.620
Yeah.

296
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.620
Your schoolmate is also strange.

297
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.500
I'm not feeling unfair anymore.

298
00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:54.820
Thank you.

299
00:14:56.900 --> 00:14:57.900
What's wrong? Does the wound hurt again?

300
00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:01.020
Are you okay?

301
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.500
I'll be going out for a while.

302
00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.420
Dear.

303
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:25.300
This is the Imperial Palace,
not my residence.

304
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.060
Don't wander around.

305
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:27.660
I...

306
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:45.900
Your Majesty.

307
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.020
For this grand occasion,

308
00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:48.420
I specially brought

309
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.700
a batch of fresh crabs from Haifang

310
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.820
to serve as a wine accompaniment
for you and other officials.

311
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.140
Ling.

312
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.540
How did you manage to transport the crabs

313
00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.300
all the way from Haifang to the capital?

314
00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.900
I first transported the crabs

315
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.140
to the port nearest to the capital,

316
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:02.500
and put them in barrels

317
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.140
filled with seawater,

318
00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.300
and then rushed all the way here

319
00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.540
for 600 miles.

320
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.820
The crabs are still alive

321
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.180
and tasty.

322
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:13.300
You're resourceful indeed.

323
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.140
All right.

324
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.660
Bring the crabs

325
00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.180
so that all of you

326
00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.380
can enjoy them.

327
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:54.900
I thought they were cooked
in some other way.

328
00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:55.900
If His Majesty

329
00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:56.780
enjoys the food,

330
00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.380
we must enjoy it, too.

331
00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.260
Do you remember?

332
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:01.180
Everyone.

333
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:03.660
Let's have a taste.

334
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:14.220
Mr. Ning. Mrs. Ning.

335
00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.260
Why aren't you eating?

336
00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:18.660
Have you never had crabs before

337
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.420
and you don't know how to peel them?

338
00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.660
It's okay.

339
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.420
I'll have someone peel them for you.

340
00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:23.020
Here.

341
00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.560
That won't be necessary.

342
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.180
Dear, look.

343
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.860
Actually, this is not the best way

344
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.740
to cook crabs.

345
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.660
What do you mean?

346
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.220
Let me tell you

347
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.180
how I used to eat crabs.

348
00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.420
Marinate the crabs in a mixture of

349
00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.500
one catty of water, four taels of salt,

350
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.420
and some white wine.

351
00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.100
It would taste

352
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.100
amazing.

353
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.740
You know what, next time,

354
00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:52.140
I'm gonna...

355
00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:52.620
Dear.

356
00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.660
His Majesty is still here.

357
00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.420
You'd better behave yourself.

358
00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.500
Mr. Ning, are you stopping
Mrs. Ning from eating

359
00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.900
because you're afraid
she might eat too quickly?

360
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:03.900
It's okay.

361
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:05.180
Let's give

362
00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.580
Mrs. Ning one more crab.

363
00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:07.660
If she does

364
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:08.740
like them,

365
00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:11.260
I can also have someone
deliver them to your mansion.

366
00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:14.100
After all, not everyone

367
00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:15.940
is able to enjoy such a delicacy.

368
00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.500
That won't be necessary, Mr. Ling.

369
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:19.500
Look.

370
00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:20.580
You've gone to great lengths

371
00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.580
to transport these crabs 600 miles

372
00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.140
from Haifang to the capital.

373
00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.180
It required financial, material,
and human resources,

374
00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.460
which must have cost you a lot.

375
00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:29.380
Those who know

376
00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.580
might see your loyalty to His Majesty,

377
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.860
but those who don't know

378
00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:34.860
might think you're wasting
manpower and money.

379
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.100
Mrs. Ning, you're being impudent!

380
00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.820
You're not only satirizing me.

381
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.100
You're also satirizing His Majesty!

382
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.100
Your Majesty.

383
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:41.340
I...

384
00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.340
My wife has no such intention.

385
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.940
Mr. Ling, don't overthink.

386
00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:46.740
Your Majesty.

387
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.700
Mr. Ling has misunderstood me.

388
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:50.100
I just want to tell him

389
00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:51.660
there is another way to cook crabs

390
00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:52.580
that is less troublesome

391
00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.700
and can also preserve

392
00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:54.660
the freshness of the seafood.

393
00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.180
Do you know

394
00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:00.660
any other way?

395
00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.740
Of course, there is a method

396
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.900
called "marinating the crab".

397
00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.420
- Marinating...
- Dear.

398
00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:07.620
What is this method of

399
00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.900
"marinating the crab"?

400
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:11.260
If you're interested,

401
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.420
I'll do it for you

402
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.580
right now.

403
00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.460
Okay. Go ahead.

404
00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.100
Your Majesty, as the saying goes,

405
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.260
"It would be a waste of eyes
not to visit Mount Lu,

406
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.580
and a waste of stomach

407
00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.740
not to eat crabs."

408
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.180
When it comes to crabs,

409
00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.900
the key is

410
00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:33.420
freshness.

411
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:34.580
So,

412
00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.660
the way I marinate the crabs today

413
00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.660
can preserve the freshness of the crabs

414
00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.340
to the greatest extent.

415
00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:44.620
Okay.

416
00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:45.820
Next,

417
00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.620
it needs to be

418
00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.700
marinated for a while.

419
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:51.580
Go and wait.

420
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:51.980
Yes.

421
00:19:58.900 --> 00:19:59.700
Don't be in a hurry.

422
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:00.620
Just a moment.

423
00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.380
It's done.

424
00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:12.100
Your Majesty.

425
00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.580
Are you sure it's edible?

426
00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:20.060
If His Majesty

427
00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.260
gets sick from it,

428
00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:22.940
being beheaded nine times

429
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.260
is not gonna be enough.

430
00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:25.420
Don't worry.

431
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.060
How is it?

432
00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.900
Are you asking me

433
00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.380
to eat the raw crabs?

434
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:35.260
Marinated crabs should be eaten raw.

435
00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.660
That would taste the best.

436
00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.460
Your Majesty.

437
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.140
I've never heard of
eating raw crabs before.

438
00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.940
As the divinely ordained ruler,

439
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.740
you shouldn't eat raw food.

440
00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:46.420
Mr. Ling.

441
00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:47.620
Don't take your ignorance

442
00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.500
for your personality, okay?

443
00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.220
How is it?

444
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.420
It's fresh.

445
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.180
Great.

446
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:06.060
Everyone.

447
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:06.820
Come and have a taste of

448
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.660
Mrs. Ning's crabs.

449
00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.220
Okay!

450
00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.060
Here.

451
00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.420
Share them.

452
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.380
Have a try.

453
00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.460
I saved it for you.

454
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.660
It's delicious.

455
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:30.420
I...

456
00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:31.620
Mrs. Ning.

457
00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.860
If Mr. Ning doesn't want to eat it,

458
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.660
I'll have one more.

459
00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:42.620
This is the most delicious thing
in the world.

460
00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.180
I'm glad you like it.

461
00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:46.100
It's delicious.

462
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.940
Nie Sangyu.

463
00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:49.660
Come over and speak to me.

464
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.060
Your Majesty.

465
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.380
I want to ask you something.

466
00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:56.180
How did you know about

467
00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:58.180
this way of cooking crabs?

468
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.900
I don't know how.

469
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.180
But

470
00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:04.140
the way of marinating crabs

471
00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.260
is easy and efficient,

472
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.900
and it can preserve
the freshness of the crabs

473
00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.820
to the greatest extent.

474
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:08.420
Right?

475
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.260
Your method is much better

476
00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.380
than Ling's.

477
00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:15.060
I have one more thing to ask you.

478
00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.380
Do you have any other

479
00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:18.420
new and interesting ways of cooking?

480
00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:19.900
I do.

481
00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.100
Come up and tell me.

482
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.080
Okay.

483
00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.420
Nie Sangyu, don't be rude!

484
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:24.460
Mr. Ning.

485
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.660
Is this how you train your wife?

486
00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.660
Shut up.

487
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:30.140
Go ahead and tell me.

488
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.940
Well, Your Majesty,

489
00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.140
let me give you an example

490
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.180
of tofu.

491
00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:38.500
There are so many
different ways to cook tofu:

492
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.940
soft tofu, frozen tofu,

493
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:41.140
southern tofu, northern tofu,

494
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.260
braised tofu, fried tofu,

495
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:43.260
sizzling tofu,

496
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.980
and Yangzhou-style tofu, etc.

497
00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:45.900
You can summon me

498
00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.420
whenever you want to try them,

499
00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:47.220
and I'll cook for you.

500
00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:47.900
Okay.

501
00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:49.900
Great.

502
00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:50.740
Is there anything else?

503
00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:51.940
Yes.

504
00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.900
There is a kind of medicinal wine

505
00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:54.900
made from seahorses

506
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.140
that nourishes yin and invigorates yang.

507
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:57.050
- Sangyu.
- The wine...

508
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.580
Come down now.

509
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:09.460
Did I say too much?

510
00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.140
Ning.

511
00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:13.580
You married

512
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.420
a truly sincere and virtuous lady.

513
00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:16.420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

514
00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:19.500
Your Majesty.

515
00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.500
Today's banquet

516
00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.260
is to celebrate
the great victory of the army.

517
00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.140
I have an idea.

518
00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.900
I would like to compete with Mr. Ning
in a sword fight

519
00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.260
to liven up the atmosphere.

520
00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.420
Okay.

521
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.100
I've never seen

522
00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.380
you two competing in swordsmanship.

523
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.380
I don't think it's a good idea,
Your Majesty.

524
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.420
My husband

525
00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:39.860
has just recovered from a serious illness.

526
00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.660
He is not agile enough.

527
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.140
So...

528
00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.260
Mrs. Ning is concerned about her husband.

529
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.660
Since Ning

530
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.180
has not yet fully recovered,

531
00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:50.900
let's skip the swordplay.

532
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

533
00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.660
When His Majesty was young

534
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.100
and I acted as regent,

535
00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:01.900
I was busy with state affairs.

536
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:03.580
Although I was sick.

537
00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.420
I dared not slack off at all.

538
00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:06.940
Now

539
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.260
I'm not like the young people.

540
00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:11.700
Pour the wine.

541
00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.220
Your Majesty.

542
00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.700
I'm willing to compete in swordsmanship

543
00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:24.380
on behalf of Mr. Ning.

544
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.980
Your Majesty.

545
00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:36.580
I'm willing to compete in swordsmanship.

546
00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:38.460
But you can't.

547
00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.260
I'm willing to compete in swordsmanship.

548
00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.180
Okay.

549
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.900
Then we'll see

550
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.580
how good you two are at swordsmanship.

551
00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:49.700
I can't let Ling Jianxing know

552
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.460
that I'm hurt.

553
00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.140
But your injury...

554
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:53.980
Mr. Ling, how are we going to compete?

555
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:54.940
It's simple.

556
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.740
You and I each plant a flag,

557
00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.660
and whoever takes the other's flag first

558
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.140
is the winner.

559
00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:02.700
Okay.

560
00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.340
Mr. Ning, since you've just
recovered from your illness,

561
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.620
I'll let you make three moves first.

562
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:14.420
No need.

563
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.180
Well, then please

564
00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.580
use your full strength.

565
00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:00.460
Mr. Ning, show me what you got.

566
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.460
Fight me as if I'm your enemy!

567
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.460
Don't push it.

568
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.180
Mr. Ning.

569
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.460
I've heard that your swordsmanship
is unparalleled,

570
00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.700
but it seems like it's not that great.

571
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:56.900
Ning Yuxuan!

572
00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.900
Well...

573
00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:02.740
Be careful!

574
00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:22.500
You...

575
00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:24.940
You...

576
00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:28.140
Are you okay?

577
00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:36.420
Your Majesty, we won!

578
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:44.700
I can't let His Majesty

579
00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:46.660
find out about my injury.

580
00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:50.980
Mr. Ning.

581
00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:52.940
You can't live

582
00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:54.220
without Mrs. Ning, can you?

583
00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.140
You even relied on her
to win the competition.

584
00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:00.420
It's unfair for the two of you

585
00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.420
to fight against me alone.

586
00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:03.740
You took advantage of his illness.

587
00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:04.900
How despicable of you.

588
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:05.420
You...

589
00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:07.580
Nie Sangyu.

590
00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:09.740
Come forward. I'll speak to you.

591
00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.100
Stay five steps away from His Majesty

592
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.140
and stand there.

593
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.260
Your Majesty.

594
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:21.740
We won.

595
00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.180
Nie Sangyu.

596
00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:26.180
You are the daughter of a general.

597
00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.380
They were competing in a sword fight.

598
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:30.660
Don't you know

599
00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.860
the competition rules?

600
00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:34.900
Ning.

601
00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.060
I'll rule against you

602
00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.420
this time.

603
00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.220
But...

604
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:44.860
Do you have any complaints?

605
00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:46.900
Your Majesty.

606
00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.220
I have no complaints.

607
00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:57.700
However,

608
00:28:58.420 --> 00:28:59.900
I saw that you and your wife

609
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.820
have love and support for each other,

610
00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.500
which has deeply moved me.

611
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.420
If all husbands and wives in the world

612
00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:08.860
could be like you,

613
00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:11.740
then all families would be at peace,

614
00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:14.340
and the nation would be at peace.

615
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.420
Nie Sangyu.

616
00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:19.580
I've decided to make you
the Second-rank Lady with Imperial Mandate.

617
00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:21.820
From now on, you two will be the model

618
00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:23.420
for all couples in the world.

619
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:24.620
What do you think?

620
00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.180
I don't think it's appropriate,
Your Majesty.

621
00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.140
No,

622
00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.260
that's not what I meant.

623
00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:32.660
You don't have to do this, Your Majesty.

624
00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.060
- You're too kind.
- Nie Sangyu.

625
00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:35.820
You must thank His Majesty

626
00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:38.340
for the title bestowed upon you.

627
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:40.660
No, Your Majesty.

628
00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:41.060
I really don't...

629
00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:41.980
Dear, bow to His Majesty.

630
00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.860
I don't mean that.

631
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:44.180
Bow now.

632
00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:44.900
You...

633
00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.220
Thank you for your grace, Your Majesty.

634
00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.900
You're a titled lady now.

635
00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:14.860
Why are you still so sullen?

636
00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.140
If I had to choose between
being granted a title

637
00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:19.740
or getting a divorce,

638
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.940
I would rather not have this title.

639
00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:24.860
It's done. Don't move.

640
00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.860
I've just applied the medicine to you.

641
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.220
You know what, the dress for titled ladies

642
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.420
does look valuable.

643
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.420
I think we could sell it

644
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.500
for a lot of money.

645
00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:40.660
Yeah.

646
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.420
Unfortunately, selling the things
bestowed by the emperor

647
00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:43.980
is a capital offense.

648
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.420
I'm just saying.

649
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:51.460
Do you really think

650
00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:52.900
I like that dress?

651
00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.460
Now I'm a titled lady,

652
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:00.580
wouldn't that

653
00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.900
improve

654
00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:03.580
my reputation?

655
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.260
I guess.

656
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.260
Then wouldn't it

657
00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.900
be a boost for my business?

658
00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:12.100
Scar Recovering Cream
with Imperial Mandate.

659
00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.060
It sounds expensive.

660
00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:16.180
But we're getting a divorce.

661
00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.620
Only the wife of an official

662
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.740
can be granted with imperial mandate.

663
00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:37.420
I think

664
00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.660
we can't rush this.

665
00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:39.820
You're not in a hurry
to get a divorce, right?

666
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.100
I think

667
00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.700
we need

668
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.500
a cooling-off period.

669
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.900
It's good for everyone.

670
00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:52.660
I saved your life today.

671
00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.180
We can postpone the divorce
for a few days, right?

672
00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.340
Sure.

673
00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:00.500
I'll hold a tea party here

674
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.340
in a few days

675
00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.340
to celebrate

676
00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.420
that you're a titled lady now

677
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:04.460
and express gratitude to His Majesty.

678
00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.860
Prepare well.

679
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:08.380
Do we need to go through
all this trouble?

680
00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.420
Just bear with it.

681
00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.380
We have to follow the rules.

682
00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:15.420
Okay.

683
00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:16.940
We don't have to get a divorce,

684
00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.260
but we have to keep track
of our accounts clearly.

685
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.220
Okay. What accounts?

686
00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.180
The accounts of what we did as a couple.

687
00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.380
This is it.

688
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.460
Before we get a formal divorce,

689
00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:49.060
we will each spend our own money

690
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.100
and keep track of the accounts.

691
00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:52.980
Watch carefully.

692
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.580
Each bead here

693
00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.660
represents 100 taels.

694
00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:56.940
The blue beads are yours.

695
00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.340
The red ones are mine.

696
00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.500
Starting from the day

697
00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.060
I asked for a divorce,

698
00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:01.660
whoever does something nice

699
00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:03.060
for the other

700
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:03.860
will put a bead

701
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:04.860
into this box.

702
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.380
And whoever does
something wrong to the other

703
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.140
will take out a bead

704
00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:08.060
from the box.

705
00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.180
We'll settle the accounts
at the day of divorce.

706
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.700
Whoever has more beads in the box

707
00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.140
can take the money.

708
00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:16.620
I'll go first.

709
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:17.580
I sewed up your wound today.

710
00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:17.980
One bead for me.

711
00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:18.900
I applied medicine for you today.

712
00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:19.660
One bead for me.

713
00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.180
I...

714
00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:22.980
They are the same thing.

715
00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:24.940
I also hid your injury from others.

716
00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:27.660
I'll let you put two beads in the box

717
00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:28.900
for these three things.

718
00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:30.660
You're so stingy.

719
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.380
I got the medicine for you today.

720
00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:34.700
One bead for me.

721
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.900
I didn't get the medicine today.

722
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.620
It doesn't count.

723
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.980
I was made Second-rank Lady
with Imperial Mandate today

724
00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.260
which brought honor to your family.

725
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:46.260
This should count as two beads.

726
00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.260
But,

727
00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:49.420
you almost

728
00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.820
exposed my injury today

729
00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:51.940
and caused unnecessary attention,

730
00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:52.740
so I'll subtract one bead.

731
00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.140
I...

732
00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.140
Fine. It's your turn.

733
00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.060
I...

734
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.220
I...

735
00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:26.180
I got you the meal standard of

736
00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.620
five dishes and one soup
at the Reflection Pavilion.

737
00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.500
It was for you.

738
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.500
I don't care.

739
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:31.620
I...

740
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:36.340
Fine.

741
00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:38.140
What's the second thing?

742
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:41.700
I'll tell you when I remember.

743
00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:44.860
Based on your current behavior,

744
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.300
the day I leave your mansion

745
00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.660
will be the day I get rich.

746
00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:59.660
Nie Sangyu.

747
00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.260
I've underestimated you.

748
00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.460
The Ning family

749
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:06.660
actually has a titled lady now.

750
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.940
You wicked woman. You don't deserve it.

751
00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.180
Mr. Ling, don't be mad.

752
00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.660
This woman suddenly showed up

753
00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:15.100
and it was truly unexpected.

754
00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:20.020
When I was competing with Ning Yuxuan,

755
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:22.140
his footsteps were light

756
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.260
with no strength.

757
00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.940
He must have been seriously injured.

758
00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:27.660
Go and find out

759
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:29.940
who hurt him.

760
00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:31.300
Yes.

761
00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.620
I'll be on it.

762
00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.660
If my guess is correct,

763
00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.220
Ning Yuxuan,

764
00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.100
your injury

765
00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.300
must be related to the bandits.

766
00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.340
His Majesty has repeatedly forbidden

767
00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:55.700
unauthorized investigations of the bandits.

768
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.580
If this is true,

769
00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.140
Ning Yuxuan,

770
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.500
you can only blame it on yourself.

771
00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:08.780
Muxu.

772
00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.580
How much do you think

773
00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.660
the dress for titled ladies is worth?

774
00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.740
It was made by the Emperor's order.

775
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:18.100
It must be worth
a thousand taels of silver.

776
00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:18.380
No.

777
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:20.820
In my eyes,

778
00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:25.020
this means countless gold.

779
00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:26.940
Countless gold?

780
00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:30.060
How much silver do we still have?

781
00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.060
I counted it yesterday.

782
00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.540
There are only 280 taels of silver left.

783
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:34.180
That's enough.

784
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.180
We'll use

785
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:38.140
50 taels

786
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.340
among the 280 taels,

787
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.940
no, 100 taels,

788
00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:41.820
to host a banquet

789
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.700
to celebrate that I was granted
with imperial mandate.

790
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:45.300
100 taels?

791
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:45.740
That's right.

792
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:46.700
Isn't it too much?

793
00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:47.460
No.

794
00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:49.460
The celebration

795
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.340
must be decorated

796
00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.180
with the most beautiful flowers

797
00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.140
and the most luxurious decorations.

798
00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.820
Make sure to serve

799
00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.180
the most expensive drinks and snacks.

800
00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:56.780
I'll invite all the royal relatives

801
00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:58.620
and nobles in the capital

802
00:36:58.860 --> 00:36:59.220
and I'll

803
00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:00.780
mingle with them

804
00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.220
as Second-rank Lady with Imperial Mandate.

805
00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:03.620
And then...

806
00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:04.740
Your Ladyship.

807
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:06.820
Nanny Liu.

808
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:07.940
Your Ladyship.

809
00:37:08.620 --> 00:37:09.580
Congratulations.

810
00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:11.380
You can move back to the Rose Garden.

811
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:12.300
Really?

812
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:15.340
His Lordship said so.

813
00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.460
Please move back
to the Rose Garden today.

814
00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:20.180
He said that?

815
00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.580
Move back to the Rose Garden.

816
00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:25.500
But I think

817
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.620
it's nice to live here.

818
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:28.380
Go back and tell him

819
00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.460
I don't want to move.

820
00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:32.860
Your Ladyship.

821
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:33.580
You are

822
00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.300
Second-rank Lady with Imperial Mandate.

823
00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:36.820
It's inappropriate for you

824
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:38.660
to live in the Reflection Pavilion now.

825
00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.180
I think it's appropriate.

826
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.620
Look at my Reflection Pavilion now.

827
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.540
I'm living well here.

828
00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.300
This is no longer

829
00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:47.940
the old Reflection Pavilion

830
00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.460
with insects and snakes.

831
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:50.780
I think it's good to live here.

832
00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.580
But this is the Reflection Pavilion.

833
00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:58.580
The name is the problem, right?

834
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.260
It's easy.

835
00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.660
To suffer a loss in one place,
but make a gain somewhere else.

836
00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.020
It's not too late.

837
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:09.980
Let's call it Feiwan Pavilion.
[*Feiwan: Not too late]

838
00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:12.180
Right.

839
00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:14.500
My scar cream

840
00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.060
will be called Feiwan Cream.

841
00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:20.460
Your Ladyship.

842
00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.940
Why don't we

843
00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.820
move back to the Rose Garden?

844
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:23.820
The Rose Garden

845
00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.100
is where the First Lady lives.

846
00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:26.980
This is a place

847
00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:27.620
for repentant people.

848
00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:28.260
Besides,

849
00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:29.860
His Lordship has often come to you lately.

850
00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:30.940
We should

851
00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:31.780
stay closer to him.

852
00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:35.820
That's right.

853
00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:38.700
Nanny Liu.

854
00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:39.820
Go back and tell him

855
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.540
that since he's been

856
00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.540
getting better lately,

857
00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.260
he doesn't need to come here so often.

858
00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:46.860
Your Lordship.

859
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.380
These are...

860
00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:55.860
Her Ladyship asked me

861
00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:56.620
to bring these things here.

862
00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:57.780
She said

863
00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:59.580
the pillow is sagging
because you slept on it,

864
00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.460
so it's yours now.

865
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:02.340
Take it away.

866
00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.180
Yes.

867
00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:05.940
What else did she do?

868
00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.940
She changed the name of Reflection Pavilion

869
00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.220
to Feiwan Pavilion

870
00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.260
and the name of Scar Recovering Cream

871
00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:11.300
to Feiwan Cream.

872
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.780
Feiwan Pavilion.

873
00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:20.300
It's never too late

874
00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.340
to cherish the time.

875
00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:25.740
That's

876
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.780
an interesting name.

877
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.060
Your Lordship, there is one more thing.

878
00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:29.660
Go ahead.

879
00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.660
Her Ladyship wants to spend

880
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.980
100 taels of silver

881
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:34.300
to entertain

882
00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.540
all the wealthy young ladies in the capital.

883
00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.500
But she thought it was too much trouble.

884
00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:39.260
Why does she

885
00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.220
want to do it with her own money now?

886
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.180
She said she would use her own money

887
00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.980
to mingle with those aristocrats

888
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.980
and sell them her products.

889
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:47.060
The money she earns

890
00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.580
will be all hers.

891
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.020
She knows how to do the math.

892
00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.740
But with her reputation,

893
00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:56.740
who will come?

894
00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:59.180
General Nie and his family

895
00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:00.780
will arrive in the capital soon.
