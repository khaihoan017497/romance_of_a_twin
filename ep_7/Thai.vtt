00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.300
(Virtue Prevails)

4
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.570
Your Ladyship,

5
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.850
it's been two hours.

6
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.080
Why

7
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.290
didn't anyone come?

8
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.080
Muxu.

9
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.960
Are you sure

10
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.770
you gave them the invitations?

11
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.520
I'm sure.

12
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.520
I sent them

13
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.440
one by one

14
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.320
to the housekeepers of other mansions.

15
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.720
It... It shouldn't be like this.

16
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.580
(Ning's Mansion)

17
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.440
General Nie.

18
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.850
Unload now.

19
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.690
Here.

20
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.440
Here.

21
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.690
Here.

22
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.850
Slow down.

23
00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:25.440
I see.

24
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.970
Your Ladyship.

25
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.720
Someone's coming now, Your Ladyship.

26
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.880
See? See?

27
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.530
I told you.

28
00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.160
It's gonna be

29
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.410
all big shots at my dinner.

30
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.970
No. They...

31
00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:35.690
See that?

32
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.970
The leader.

33
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.090
He is imposing and personable.

34
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.600
I'm sure he must be a big shot.

35
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.320
Look at his wife

36
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.320
next to him.

37
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.160
She is elegant and dignified.

38
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.640
And have you seen

39
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.600
their daughter?

40
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.970
She looks like a fairy.

41
00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.760
So beautiful.

42
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.720
Your Ladyship, have you forgotten?

43
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.440
Mr. Nie is your father.

44
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.440
And his wife next to him

45
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.690
is your mother.

46
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.530
My father? My mother?

47
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.940
(Mrs. Nie, Nie Qingyun)

48
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.880
It's Sangyu.

49
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.860
(Nie Xiangyuan)
Mother.

50
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.530
Sangyu.

51
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.760
Sangyu.

52
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.970
Is she my sister?

53
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.440
You're right.

54
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.530
Are they rich?

55
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.880
Very rich.

56
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.320
Sangyu.

57
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.090
Mother.

58
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.370
Sangyu, how you...

59
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.160
Sangyu.

60
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.290
What happened to you?

61
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.970
Is His Lordship mean to you again?

62
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.010
Father.

63
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.010
Sangyu.

64
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.200
What have you been wronged by? Tell me.

65
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.370
I'm fine.

66
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.570
He's not. Mother.

67
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.410
I'm fine.

68
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.090
Sangyu.

69
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.850
I heard you injured your head

70
00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.040
when you fell into the water.

71
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.530
So you forgot a lot of things, right?

72
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.320
Do you remember anything

73
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.570
about me?

74
00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.570
I... I...

75
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.480
I know.

76
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.880
I know my sister is

77
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.410
a smart

78
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.570
and decent girl.

79
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.600
Sangyu.

80
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:07.920
Tell me.

81
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.160
What's wrong with you?

82
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:10.320
Sangyu.

83
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.810
I...

84
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.530
Sangyu.

85
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.290
Your Ladyship.

86
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.440
You have never praised

87
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.050
your sister before.

88
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.730
You always beat her,
scolded her and lectured her.

89
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.730
Why is Sangyu

90
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:19.840
so different?

91
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.050
I see.

92
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.320
Qingyun.

93
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.280
I was blind.

94
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.370
I didn't see

95
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.320
how smart, beautiful

96
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.880
kind, generous and decent you were.

97
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.370
Father. Mother.

98
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.730
I did lose my memory

99
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.280
this time.

100
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.570
But I got better.

101
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.010
I'm gentler than before.

102
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.760
- And I'm more generous.
- Lose memory?

103
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.880
I mean it.

104
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.250
Sangyu.

105
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.050
You lost your memory.

106
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.280
Really?

107
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.810
Sangyu.

108
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.280
That's great.

109
00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.520
What are you talking about?

110
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:57.760
Watch your manners.

111
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.200
You'd better change your clothes.

112
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.440
Yes, yes, Father.

113
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.050
Come here.

114
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.960
Here. Here.

115
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:05.060
- Sangyu.
- Slow down.

116
00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.250
Your father and I brought you

117
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.440
a lot of delicious food
from the Northwest.

118
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.490
The wagon is full of goodies.

119
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.880
Most of them are put in the backyard.

120
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.810
Come here. Look.

121
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.130
They are all your favorites.

122
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.080
Mother.

123
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.370
What are these?

124
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.050
I didn't see them

125
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.810
in the capital before.

126
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:19.400
This.

127
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.930
This was your favorite

128
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:21.730
when you were a kid.

129
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.010
Honeydew melon.

130
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.520
It's our specialty in the Northwest.

131
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.440
Hami melon.

132
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.640
Northwest.

133
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.730
What other good things are there
in the Northwest?

134
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.400
There are many special things

135
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.520
in the Northwest.

136
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.690
You can't see them in the capital.

137
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.370
Very special things.

138
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:38.200
Really?

139
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:45.810
Slow down.

140
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:47.050
Where is this?

141
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.080
Let's sit there.

142
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.640
Come on.

143
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.570
Slow down.

144
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.170
Father.

145
00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.960
Sangyu.

146
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.840
What do you want? Tell me.

147
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.690
Are there really a lot of rare things

148
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:02.810
in the Northwest that

149
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.690
are not available in the capital?

150
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.960
If we bring and sell them here,

151
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.610
we will make a lot of money, right?

152
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:08.810
Do you want to do business?

153
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:10.690
What's wrong with it?

154
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.080
Sangyu.

155
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.400
You haven't been exposed
to the outside world.

156
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.690
You don't know

157
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.930
about the business thing.

158
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.840
And,

159
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.960
the capital is far from the Northwest.

160
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.080
Carriage costs must be expensive.

161
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.810
It's not

162
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.010
a good business.

163
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.490
I see.

164
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.960
Is Yuxuan

165
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.730
mean to you?

166
00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.280
Did he skimp on your food subsidy?

167
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.010
Distant...

168
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.050
I'm asking you.

169
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.760
No.

170
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.930
He never

171
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.690
skimps on my subsidy.

172
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:40.400
He doesn't dare.

173
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.010
Sangyu.

174
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.280
Now it's just you and me.

175
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.570
Let me know

176
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.610
if you have any grievances.

177
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.320
I'll back you up.

178
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.010
No. No.

179
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.490
Tell me.

180
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.960
Let me know.

181
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.010
Fine.

182
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.730
I want to divorce him.

183
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.810
I want to divorce Ning Yuxuan

184
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.640
and then open a rouge shop.

185
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.170
Divorce?

186
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.200
Open a rouge shop?

187
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.760
Right.

188
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:19.880
I've already made the decision.

189
00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.170
Father, you know what?

190
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.250
Since I woke up,

191
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:23.810
I became soberer than before.

192
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.080
I found that

193
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.690
Ning Yuxuan

194
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:26.520
didn't love me at all.

195
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.320
This man

196
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.760
is handsome,

197
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.810
but has no other merits.

198
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.730
He grinds his teeth during sleep
and is picky about food.

199
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.200
He sets many rules.

200
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.170
He is a weird guy.

201
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:34.960
The strangest thing is that

202
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.930
he doesn't let anyone near him at all.

203
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.200
I went to him and he ignored me.

204
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.080
But when I ignored him,

205
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.400
he tried to sneak at me.

206
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.610
I...

207
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.170
Stop it.

208
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.280
Sangyu.

209
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:47.880
You're the Second-rank Lady

210
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:49.250
with Imperial Mandate now.

211
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.370
How could you tell your marriage secrets

212
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:53.960
to others?

213
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.280
You're my father.

214
00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:55.760
You...

215
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.320
Stop. Stop.

216
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.440
I have to go.

217
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:00.400
Why?

218
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.320
No. I haven't finished.

219
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:03.840
Wear your titled clothes.

220
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.370
Father.

Forget it.

Well...

239
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.800
Today...

240
00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.970
We're all families.

241
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.850

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:22.280
for formalities.

Sit.

245
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.730
Father, Mother, have a seat.

246
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.370
Qingyun, sit.

247
00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.010
Have a seat.

248

(Virtue Prevails)

249
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:32.400
Dear.

250
00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:35.640
That's your seat.

251
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:38.040
I don't want to sit there.

252
00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.640
You pay

253
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.400
for the party.

254
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:43.130
You should sit there, of course.

255
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:03.610
Sangyu.

256
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:05.800
Why don't you say something?

257
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:08.010
What?

258
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:09.160
I'm not in the mood.

259
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:11.040
Come on.

260
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.680
Give her a big hand.

261
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.520
What should I say?

262
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.800
Sangyu. Say something.

263
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.850
Your Ladyship, please say something.

264
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.330
Fine.

265
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:29.210
I'll say something.

266
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.330
Today...

267
00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:40.880
Everyone, have fun.

268
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:43.210
Come on.

269
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.130
Are you done?

270
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.370
Yes.

271
00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.160
You know,

272
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:00.640
the other day,

273
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:01.450
the First Lady was conferred

274
00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:03.370
as the Second-rank Lady
with Imperial Mandate.

275
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.450
This title

276
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.640
is the highest one for women.

277
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.450
So I hope she will do better

278
00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.130
in the future.

279
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:12.450
She will be a model
for all women in the world.

280
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:13.370
That's all.

281
00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.370
Besides,

282
00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.090
I will

283
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:24.130
tell you a secret.

284
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.640
The snacks and tea

285
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:26.730
on your table

286
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.130
are all treated by Sangyu.

287
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.880
She is generous to

288
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.010
take her own 100 taels of silver

289
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.370
to buy specialties

290
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.040
from time-honored shops in the capital.

291
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.090
Alright. I see

292
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.880
some seats in the distance

293
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:42.640
are empty.

294
00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:44.280
It's their loss that

295
00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:46.160
they didn't come.

296
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.520
Why aren't you done?

297
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.090
Sit.

298
00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:52.400
Come on.

299
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.970
How about

300
00:11:53.970 --> 00:11:54.880
we propose a toast to

301
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:56.130
this generous titled lady?

302
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:03.330
You...

303
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.920
Sangyu, thank you for paying
so many taels of silver

304
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.330
to prepare the banquet for us.

305
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.400
You're so kind.

306
00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.330
Thank you.

307
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.330
Thanks, Your Ladyship.

308
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:19.250
Everyone.

309
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.280
Money will come and go.

310
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.850
Enjoy yourself.

311
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.090
Have fun.

312
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:25.520
I'd like to propose a toast.

313
00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:33.250
Have a seat.

314
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.210
Sit down.

315
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:48.850
I think you should

316
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.090
pay for this banquet.

317
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:50.680
Why?

318
00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.130
Because you're my husband.

319
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.040
We're still married.

320
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.250
Right.

321
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:55.850
But the rule in
the Ning's Mansion is that

322
00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:56.970
all expenses should be reported

323
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.210
in advance.

324
00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:00.370
I was gonna help you

325
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.400
pay for this banquet.

326
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.400
But

327
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:04.640
you'd like to

328
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.130
spend 100 taels of silver

329
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:06.880
to hold this banquet.

330
00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:07.760
Well...

331
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.040
I can't refuse you, right?

332
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.560
Can you pay half the price?

333
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:35.880
Thanks.

334
00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.280
But it doesn't conform to the rules.

335
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:38.880
No way.

336
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:50.450
Look.

337
00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:52.330
Do you think

338
00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.060
this cookie looks like three cents

339
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.800
out of the 100 taels?

340
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.250
I'll eat enough

341
00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.130
to make all my money back.

342
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.520
If it's not enough,
I will drink them all.

343
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:07.970
That's it.

344
00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.560
Delicious.

345
00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.330
That's the real osmanthus wine
of Qingshui Tavern.

346
00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:20.400
Ten taels for one flagon.

347
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.520
I'll drink it

348
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.330
one tael by one tael.

349
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.610
80 taels.

350
00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:24.490
I'll drink them all.

351
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.280
Come on.

352
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.880
Your Ladyship, that's enough.

353
00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.010
You've drunk five flagons.

354
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.450
Just five flagons.

355
00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.210
Five...

356
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:31.920
I want to drink.

357
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.450
That's not enough.

358
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:39.210
Your Ladyship.

359
00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:41.160
Do you want to drink enough

360
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.450
for the 100 taels?

361
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.400
What? Can't I?

362
00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:45.610
There's no need.

363
00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.640
If you get yourself sick,

364
00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.880
it'll cost you money to see a doctor.

365
00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.280
It's not your business.

366
00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:59.160
Don't think you can meddle
with my things

367
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.730
as my husband now.

368
00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:03.730
I...

369
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:04.450
And

370
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.850
I want to drink enough

371
00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:06.800
for the payment.

372
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.490
I'll drink.

373
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:10.250
Sangyu.

374
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.330
Watch your behavior.

375
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.490
Father.

376
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.210
I told you.

377
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:17.680
Your Ladyship.

378
00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:19.010
He...

379
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.160
He's always in charge of me.

380
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:22.520
You say...

381
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.730
You're drunk.

382
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.490
I... I'm not.

383
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:27.920
You're drunk. Watch your behavior.

384
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:35.560
Dear.

385
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:36.850
You're drunk.

386
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:37.490
No.

387
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.210
You're drunk.

388
00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:39.560
I'm not. No...

389
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.040
Yes.

390
00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.370
Master, what's wrong?

391
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:02.680
Never mind.

392
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:15.640
You...

393
00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:18.640
You look like

394
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.280
my Mr. Right.

395
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.040
Your Lordship.

396
00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:33.680
Her Ladyship is drunk.

397
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.730
How about I send her back

398
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.370
to Feiwan Pavilion to rest?

399
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.850
You look like my Mr. Right.

400
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:42.210
Muxu.

401
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.490
Your Lordship.

402
00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.400
Send her back.

403
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:45.130
Your Ladyship.

404
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:47.680
- Muxu, have you smelled
- Let's hurry back.

405
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.640
something

406
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:50.610
in the yard?

407
00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:52.610
Smell?

408
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:55.160
What's the smell?

409
00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:03.640
Sweet smell.

410
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.650
It's a sweet smell.

411
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.250
Sweet.

412
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.040
Sweet smell.

413
00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.690
It's the sweet smell of my Mr. Right.

414
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:22.010
So sweet.

415
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:26.100
(Longxing Inn)

416
00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:33.930
Mother.

417
00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.690
Why are you crying again?

418
00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:38.690
Master.

419
00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:41.170
Didn't you see it?

420
00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:42.410
When I think of Sangyu's behavior

421
00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.210
at the banquet today,

422
00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.730
I feel sad.

423
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.690
We usually

424
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.600
dote on her.

425
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:49.730
But we don't know

426
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:51.120
how Ning Yuxuan bullied her

427
00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.010
to have this weird personality.

428
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:55.280
Mother.

429
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.690
I'll teach Ning Yuxuan a lesson.

430
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.010
I'll ask him to treat Sangyu well.

431
00:17:58.010 --> 00:17:59.010
Enough for that.

432
00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:00.220
Calm down.

433
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:01.930
Otherwise,

434
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.430
I'll send you back to the Northwest.

435
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:03.860
I...

436
00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:06.120
Qingyun.

437
00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:08.600
Qingyun.

438
00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:09.890
You!

439
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:11.840
This... Master.

440
00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:14.760
You go to take care of her.

441
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:15.890
Don't let her do anything stupid.

442
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.360
Xiangyuan,

443
00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:25.080
I can't live

444
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.930
in the martial world

445
00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:26.970
with two

446
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.450
hungry babies.

447
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.930
If I have other choices,

448
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.280
I'll never give this child to you.

449
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:36.120
Don't worry.

450
00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.040
My wife and I have been married
for over a year

451
00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:40.250
and have no children.

452
00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.010
I'll take this child

453
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:44.930
as my own daughter.

454
00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:45.760
From now on,

455
00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.250
this child will take your surname.

456
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.410
You will raise her,

457
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.210
so you are her father.

458
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.450
This jade pendant is precious.

459
00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:56.170
It was given by a noble person

460
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:57.600
when these two children were born.

461
00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:58.970
That's the only thing I can leave

462
00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:59.690
for my children.

463
00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.450
I'll leave this jade pendant
of the right moon

464
00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:02.650
to the elder sister.

465
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:03.890
It's a token

466
00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:04.760
for their recognition.

467
00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:09.210
Don't worry.

468
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.560
I'll protect this jade pendant

469
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.040
for this child.

470
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:13.170
They will

471
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.760
meet each other one day.

472
00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.490
This jade pendant

473
00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.760
is their token.

474
00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.320
Go to my hometown, Luan County,

475
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:40.760
to find a man named Ji Ming.

476
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:41.890
Remember.

477
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.560
You must find him.

478
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:46.840
Yes, sir.

479
00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:58.890
Your Lordship.

480
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.840
Feiwan Pavilion reported that

481
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.250
Her Ladyship fell asleep.

482
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.040
She tossed for a day

483
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.010
and finally fell asleep.

484
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.970
Have a rest.

485
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:11.730
Yes, sir.

486
00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:13.930
Wait a minute.

487
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.080
Tell the bureau

488
00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:19.970
to pay for

489
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:22.490
this banquet.

490
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.520
Your Lordship, are you...

491
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.930
Why do you ask so much?

492
00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:26.490
Do it.

493
00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:27.360
Yes, sir.

494
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.730
Ning Yuxuan.

495
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:44.730
Ning Yuxuan.

496
00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.520
Ning Yuxuan.

497
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.280
I think my head hurts.

498
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:05.120
My legs hurt.

499
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.360
My body

500
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.890
also hurts.

501
00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:15.930
You hurt all over, right?

502
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.250
Go back to bed then.

503
00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.410
Anyway, I'm going to sleep.

504
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.210
Got you.

505
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.360
See?

506
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.800
Since we're married now,

507
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.970
we should do something

508
00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.760
especially between husband and wife.

509
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:46.120
You...

510
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:46.820
Shush.

511
00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:47.840
Stop it.

512
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:52.180
♪I'm happy but proud♪

513
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:54.890
♪I caught a glimpse of your smile♪

514
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:58.030
♪Life has thousands of troubles♪

515
00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.940
♪But now we're having fun♪

516
00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:22.730
You are my Mr. Right.

517
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:26.730
Look.

518
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.650
You're cute.

519
00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.600
Again? You...

520
00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:38.690
What do you want to do?

521
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.210
Come back.

522
00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:43.730
Nie Sangyu, what do you want to do?

523
00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:44.970
Don't go.

524
00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.120
We're married.

525
00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.040
We should do something.

526
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:48.930
Don't run away.

527
00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:50.010
Go back to sleep.

528
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.080
What are you doing?

529
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:53.410
Don't run.

530
00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:54.170
I...

531
00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.250
Stop.

532
00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.320
Why are you so mean to me?

533
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:03.800
Sangyu.

534
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:06.410
Come here.

535
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:10.410
Come here.

536
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.250
I'm coming.

537
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.970
Yuxuan, let me go.

538
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:22.250
Yuxuan, let me go.

539
00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:23.360
Yuxuan.

540
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.760
Let me go.

541
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.120
Put me down.

542
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:33.280
Put me down. Now.

543
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.730
Let me go.

544
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:37.280
Let me go. Let me go.

545
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:38.690
Let me go.

546
00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:40.410
Put me down.

547
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:42.520
Let me go.

548
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.890
Nie Sangyu, she's a devil.

549
00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:49.360
How dare she ruin my reputation
in the banquet?

550
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.760
Now she even wore the titled clothes

551
00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.320
to hold the banquet.

552
00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.010
I'll let her know

553
00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.840
the notorious feeling.

554
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:00.840
Mr. Ling.

555
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.520
Nie Sangyu is already notorious now.

556
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.080
Not enough.

557
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:07.760
Yes, sir.

558
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.280
You said

559
00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:12.120
Ning Yuxuan was hurt by rogues.

560
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:13.760
Really?

561
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:14.970
That's true.

562
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.450
He violated the order

563
00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:17.690
to privately investigate the rogues

564
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:19.080
and found the wrong person.

565
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:20.690
Explain more.

566
00:24:21.490 --> 00:24:21.970
That night,

567
00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.040
Ning Yuxuan received the news

568
00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:24.800
from nowhere that

569
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.210
there were rogues gathering

570
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:27.170
in a broken temple in West City,

571
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.120
so he hurried over.

572
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.760
But there were

573
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.170
no rogues at all.

574
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.320
Only some refugees were here.

575
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:40.010
Was Ning Yuxuan injured by them?

576
00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:42.170
Someone among them.

577
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.360
In order to avenge his father,

578
00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:45.800
Ning Yuxuan has been hunting down
rogues over the years

579
00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.210
by fierce ways.

580
00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.360
Refugees hate him.

581
00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:55.250
We can say he used his power

582
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.690
for personal revenge.

583
00:24:58.170 --> 00:24:59.410
Does the Ministry of Justice
know something?

584
00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:01.120
Mr. Wang of the Ministry of Justice

585
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:02.560
doesn't like him either.

586
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.690
So

587
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.650
if rogues were killed,

588
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:13.560
the Ministry of Justice

589
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.280
will first doubt...

590
00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:26.060
(Virtue Prevails)

591
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:40.210
Muxu.

592
00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:43.120
Your Ladyship, you woke up.

593
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.010
Help me up.

594
00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.560
Why does my head hurt so much?

595
00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:54.280
Your Ladyship.

596
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.490
Don't you remember?

597
00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:59.450
You were drunk at the banquet.

598
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:03.840
Then?

599
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.040
Then...

600
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.600
Then...

601
00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.040
I don't know how to say it.

602
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:11.250
Just say it.

603
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:12.730
I thought

604
00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:13.890
you didn't like His Lordship anymore.

605
00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.280
But last night,

606
00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.970
last night, you...

607
00:26:18.450 --> 00:26:19.210
You were so...

608
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.490
What?

609
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.450
Yesterday, at the banquet,

610
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.840
in front of all of us,

611
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.040
you hugged His Lordship

612
00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:32.320
and said he was your Mr. Right.

613
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:34.840
What?

614
00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.320
There's more.

615
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.760
Later you went to His Lordship's room

616
00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:42.800
and was brought back

617
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.930
with the cotton quilt by His Lordship.

618
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.490
Is it his quilt?

619
00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:49.410
Who changed my clothes?

620
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:52.040
Please tell me he didn't touch me.

621
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.840
No, no. I changed your clothes.

622
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:57.320
It was you who wanted to

623
00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.120
touch...

624
00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:01.650
Touch His Lordship.

625
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:04.890
His Lordship had no choice

626
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.210
but stopped you by wrapping you

627
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:07.210
in a cotton quilt.

628
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.690
After coming back,

629
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:10.930
you yelled that you wanted

630
00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.800
to sleep

631
00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:14.280
with His Lordship

632
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.890
and fought overnight.

633
00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:18.520
No. No. No.

634
00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:19.970
No.

635
00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:22.650
How many beads

636
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:24.800
will I be skimped by him?

637
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:26.520
Well, Your Ladyship.

638
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:27.490
The housekeeper

639
00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.890
has just sent a 100-tael bank note.

640
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.120
He said His Lordship will pay

641
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.560
for yesterday's banquet.

642
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:33.320
Your Ladyship.

643
00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:34.560
His Lordship is more and more

644
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.800
interested in you.

645
00:27:36.170 --> 00:27:37.120
Maybe

646
00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.600
if you try harder,

647
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.450
you'll be able to sleep

648
00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:42.280
with His Lordship.

649
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:43.800
What are you talking about?

650
00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:46.080
Now I just want to...

651
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:47.120
I just want to

652
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.250
broaden the market for face cream

653
00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:49.490
and get rid of the fame of being a devil.

654
00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.690
I didn't think about anything else.

655
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.320
You can't believe a drunk woman.

656
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.160
Listen!

657
00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.410
Can you believe
the No.1 She-devil of the Capital

658
00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.680
killed horses and ate their meat?

659
00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:13.720
See? See what are they

660
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.640
talking about?

661
00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:15.840
Kill horses and eat their meat?

662
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.080
I didn't do that.

663
00:28:17.890 --> 00:28:19.360
- Nonsense.
- Your Ladyship.

664
00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.760
Your Ladyship, keep your voice down.

665
00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:22.080
Let me go.

666
00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:22.890
I didn't do anything wrong.

667
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:23.760
Why should I hide?

668
00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.320
Your Ladyship, you don't know that.

669
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.840
There are some priggish scholars
in the capital.

670
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:27.930
These deadbeat guys

671
00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:29.360
always gather

672
00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.410
to slander

673
00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:31.280
or boast about others.

674
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.170
As long as you give them money,

675
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.120
they dare to say

676
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:33.970
and write anything.

677
00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.490
It's them.

678
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.320
But they can't say nonsense.

679
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.280
Yes.

680
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.080
A gentleman makes money
in the right way.

681
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:45.010
What they got was black money.

682
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.560
Cash a paycheck?

683
00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:50.690
Cash a paycheck.

684
00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:54.930
That's weird.

685
00:29:00.170 --> 00:29:01.360
(I'll go find out.)

686
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.490
(How dare you,
a priggish scholar, slander me?)

687
00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:06.090
(Hefeng Restaurant)
(I'll take you to the government.)

688
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.320
No.1 She-devil of the Capital.

689
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.080
Come back.

690
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.730
She is the No.1 She-devil
of the Capital,

691
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:11.730
Nie Sangyu.

692
00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:12.800
I...

693
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.600
Is she Nie Sangyu?

694
00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:16.690
I'm not.

695
00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:17.450
It's her!

696
00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:18.730
I'm not.

697
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.730
It's her.

698
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:22.890
I am. But I didn't...

699
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:24.560
It's you. It's you.

700
00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.210
You're the She-devil of the Capital.

701
00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:27.730
It's you.

702
00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:28.730
It's her. It's her.

703
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.360
You're the She-devil. It's you.

704
00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.280
Listen.

705
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:32.320
He slandered me.

706
00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:33.410
It's him.

707
00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:35.450
Explain to everybody.

708
00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:40.840
Smash her.

709
00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:51.490
Stop.

710
00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:54.320
Stop.

711
00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:01.840
Turn around.

712
00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.840
Turn around.

713
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:17.800
How did you make yourself like this?

714
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.650
What's wrong with you?

715
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:27.690
I got screwed by priggish scholars.

716
00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:29.010
Who?

717
00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:30.520
Some guys

718
00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.360
who slander others.

719
00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.120
When I walked out on the street today,

720
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.490
everyone

721
00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:34.800
called me the She-devil of the Capital.

722
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:36.600
They said I killed horses
and ate their meat.

723
00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:39.490
It must be Ling Jianxing.

724
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:40.760
I just embarrassed him

725
00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:41.930
last time.

726
00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:43.650
How could he let
all the priggish scholars in the capital

727
00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:44.970
slander me?

728
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.410
I didn't offend anyone.

729
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:50.320
You think

730
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.600
it's Ling Jianxing.

731
00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.120
Do you

732
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:53.600
have any evidence?

733
00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:54.320
Yes.

734
00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:57.970
But I know they will never admit it.

735
00:30:58.280 --> 00:30:58.730
Okay.

736
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:00.840
I see.

737
00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:02.520
Don't worry.

738
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.010
I'll handle this.

739
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:15.250
You?

740
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:18.650
Really?

741
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:22.730
I'll keep my word.

742
00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.930
You must think about a good way.

743
00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:26.210
They are evil,

744
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.520
always saying dirty words.

745
00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.690
They are bad.

746
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.650
I didn't do those things.

747
00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.120
I'm not that kind of woman.

748
00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.650
It's just nonsense.

749
00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.250
Don't listen to them.

750
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:45.450
Otherwise, you'll be sad.

751
00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.560
Don't listen to them,

752
00:31:56.410 --> 00:31:57.010
okay?

753
00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.650
Stop listening to them.

754
00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.930
Here is a red bead for you.

755
00:32:18.250 --> 00:32:19.170
Do you feel better?

756
00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.040
I... I...

757
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:35.890
I...

758
00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.520
I... I don't have it anymore.

759
00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:42.970
I'll give you a blue bead.

760
00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.490
Can you hug me?

761
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.010
Why did they say that about me?

762
00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.320
I didn't do those things.

763
00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:00.650
That's okay. Alright.

764
00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:01.650
Never mind.

765
00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:03.690
We must admit

766
00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:04.970
what we did.

767
00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.520
But we should never admit

768
00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:08.320
what we didn't do.

769
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:10.730
That's okay.

770
00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:13.490
I'll handle it.

771
00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:31.080
Boss.

772
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.010
It's late.

773
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.250
What are we doing here?

774
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:34.450
I heard Lackey Ning

775
00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.690
has been to this ruined temple
with someone.

776
00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:37.210
Maybe there are some clues
about the Tea Gang.

777
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.360
Let's check it.

778
00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:40.250
Once people of the Tea Gang

779
00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.250
were arrested by Lackey Ning,

780
00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.800
they would be tortured.

781
00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:44.280
I'll do my best to help them.

782
00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.120
Mom.

783
00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.200
Boss.

784
00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:54.640
- Boss.
- Boss.

785
00:35:54.770 --> 00:35:55.490
Should we chase them?

786
00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:56.890
Check for the survivors.

787
00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:57.720
The priority is to save lives.

788
00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:58.720
Yes, sir.

789
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:02.080
Come on.

790
00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:10.540
(Breadth of Mind)

791
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:27.600
Muxu.

792
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.720
Didn't Ning Yuxuan say

793
00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:29.600
to help me get revenge?

794
00:36:29.970 --> 00:36:31.080
Why is he still here?

795
00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:32.120
Your Ladyship, take it easy.

796
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.450
Only one night has passed.

797
00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.560
No matter how marvelous His Lordship is,

798
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.120
he must need time to act.

799
00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:42.450
Today.

800
00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.080
Come.

801
00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:49.890
He...

802
00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:54.240
Why can't he speak?

803
00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:57.160
Today.

804
00:36:59.080 --> 00:36:59.970
He is dumb.

805
00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:00.770
Dumb?

806
00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:01.970
Really?

807
00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:05.160
He can't speak.

808
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.010
Dumb?

809
00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:08.240
Muxu.

810
00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:09.010
It...

811
00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.600
It couldn't be Ning Yuxuan, right?

812
00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:14.160
Hurry up. Go back to figure it out.

813
00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.200
I want to know the truth.

814
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.120
Go. Go.

815
00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:18.560
Say something.

816
00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:20.490
Say it.

817
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:21.970
Step down.

818
00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:23.850
Go.

819
00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:26.770
Master Liao Ran.

820
00:37:27.330 --> 00:37:28.560
Please take care

821
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:30.010
of those surviving refugees.

822
00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.410
(Buddha's Light Shines)
Don't worry.

823
00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:36.520
Well,

824
00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:37.640
there is

825
00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:38.850
a weird thing

826
00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.240
about the assassins who kill refugees.

827
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:42.770
I saw the mark of the Tea Gang

828
00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.560
in their bodies.

829
00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.500
Could it be that someone is pretending
to work for the Tea Gang

830
00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:50.900
doing bad things?

831
00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:52.860
No way.

832
00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:54.340
It's been

833
00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:56.460
so many years.

834
00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:58.860
Apart from Yuxuan,

835
00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.620
not many people know about the Tea Gang,

836
00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.220
either in court or on the street.

837
00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:05.700
Maybe

838
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.300
the survivors of the Tea Gang

839
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:09.140
joined other factions.

840
00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.230
I'll

841
00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.740
figure it out.

842
00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.340
I can't stand it

843
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.840
if someone is pretending

844
00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:16.900
to work for the Tea Gang

845
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:19.020
to do evil things.

846
00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.940
I'll kill them for the Tea Gang.

847
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:31.660
Sir.

848
00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:32.860
These stories

849
00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.660
have spread throughout the capital.

850
00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:36.500
They are vivid,

851
00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:37.620
attracting,

852
00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:39.020
and even like real stories.

853
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:40.500
So interesting.

854
00:38:40.980 --> 00:38:42.410
Guess who the She-devil
of the Capital is?

855
00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.780
It's Lackey Ning's wife,

856
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.580
Nie Sangyu.

857
00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.420
Who spread the rumor?

858
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:53.620
Priggish... Priggish scholars.

859
00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:54.780
These days,

860
00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.100
all the priggish scholars in the capital

861
00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:57.020
have spread the stories.

862
00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.700
They all compete to interpret the story

863
00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.580
of the She-devil of the Capital.

864
00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.180
Sir.

865
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.460
Sir.

866
00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.220
Listen. I can tell you.

867
00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:14.820
Your Ladyship. Your Ladyship.

868
00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:16.700
What? Have you figured it out?

869
00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:17.460
Yes.

870
00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.620
All priggish scholars in the capital

871
00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:19.580
became dumb

872
00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:20.860
overnight.

873
00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:22.100
What?

874
00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.620
(No. No.)

875
00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.500
(No.)

876
00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.860
I know His Lordship can handle this.

877
00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:29.540
That's true.

878
00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:31.020
He did such a big thing

879
00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:32.620
by only one night.

880
00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:33.580
No.

881
00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.060
Everyone in the capital

882
00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:36.580
may doubt the stories

883
00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:37.580
about the No.1 She-devil of the Capital,

884
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.060
but now all priggish scholars

885
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:39.500
are dumb.

886
00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.020
Who would everyone think that did it?

887
00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.780
It asserted that

888
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.660
I'm the No.1 She-devil of the Capital.

889
00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:47.500
Your Ladyship.

890
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:50.420
Maybe you're right.

891
00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.580
What... What can we do?

892
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:55.420
What can we do? What can we do? What...

893
00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:58.100
Shut up.

894
00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.060
I'll cook you

895
00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.020
if you say moo again.

896
00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:15.100
Sir.

897
00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.660
I'm kidding, sir.

898
00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:19.220
Sir. I'm sorry. Sorry.

899
00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:19.660
Sorry.

900
00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.020
Well...

901
00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.860
What can we do, Your Ladyship?

902
00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.020
Do you want to eat meat?

903
00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:27.660
Who?

904
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.020
Is... Is it them? I don't think so.
