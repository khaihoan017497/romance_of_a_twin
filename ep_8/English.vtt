00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.980
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.770
Sir.

4
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.320
I'm kidding, sir.

5
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.880
Sir, I'm sorry. Sorry.

6
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.320
Sorry.

7
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.650
Well...

8
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.490
What can we do, Your Ladyship?

9
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.690
Do you want to eat meat?

10
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.320
Who?

11
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.650
Is... Is it them? I don't think so.

12
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.050
It's you.

13
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.130
Miss Nie, I heard

14
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.200
some malicious gossip about you

15
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.370
upset you.

16
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:12.690
Then I came for you.

17
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.250
Do I look so upset?

18
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.410
Yes.

19
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.650
In this case,

20
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.810
how about you go somewhere with me

21
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.650
for some fresh air?

22
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.280
Fresh air?

23
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.370
Where?

24
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.840
You'll know.

25
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.440
Your Lordship,

26
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.020
I took care of everything

27
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.900
as you asked me to.

28
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.580
You have to do this perfectly

29
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.260
so that the scholars'...

30
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.300
The priggish scholars' dirty tricks

31
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.020
would totally disappear in the capital.

32
00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.860
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.180
What can make you happy?
Nothing but food.

34
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.780
Here. Eat it before it gets cold.

35
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.620
I had planned

36
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.900
to take you to enjoy some meat.

37
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.740
But the streets were crowded

38
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.260
where you might be recognized.

39
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.780
So,

40
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.340
I brought you to such a quiet place

41
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.460
for roast vegetable pancakes.

42
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.460
Are you okay with it?

43
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.740
Yes.

44
00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.180
I'm not fussy about food.

45
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.300
I can eat anything.

46
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.820
But I didn't kill the horse or eat it.

47
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.100
I didn't do that.

48
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.340
I know.

49
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.220
Glad you like the pancake.

50
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.140
The pancake was

51
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.380
the happiest memory

52
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.900
of my childhood.

53
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.100
Your childhood?

54
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.580
Did your mother roast it for you?

55
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.460
She died when I was very young.

56
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.140
My father and uncles

57
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.820
brought me up.

58
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.660
Oh, my apologies.

59
00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.340
My family was very poor.

60
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.580
Then, my uncles

61
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.020
roasted such pancakes for me.

62
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.020
So,

63
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.900
you grew up

64
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.820
in a big family.

65
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.020
Unfortunately, that family

66
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.140
is gone.

67
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.780
How?

68
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.580
Some villains burned my village

69
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.900
and nearly all of them died.

70
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.140
Over all these years,

71
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.340
I've been looking

72
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.780
for my uncles' children,

73
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.460
hoping someday I could

74
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.020
reunite with them.

75
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.380
Have you found them?

76
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.380
Yes.

77
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.020
But only one...

78
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.460
One who can't recognize me.

79
00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.380
You've found one

80
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.780
who can't recognize you?

81
00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.260
We're off my thing.

82
00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:02.540
Let's talk about you.

83
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.780
Me?

84
00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.820
Nothing's fun about me.

85
00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.260
Miss Nie,

86
00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.260
how's it going with your cosmetic shop?

87
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.700
Don't mention it.

88
00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.380
Rumors go everywhere

89
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.020
that I killed a horse and ate it.

90
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.380
How can I start my shop now?

91
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.460
But anyway,

92
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.660
I'll open my own shop someday.

93
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.820
You also dream to have a shop?

94
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.780
So do you?

95
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.460
I think you're a capable woman

96
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.260
and you'll do great business.

97
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.380
Do you really think so?

98
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.460
Not to brag,

99
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.020
but I've met many businessmen.

100
00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.780
Speaking of vision,

101
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.700
you're absolutely more far-sighted.

102
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.700
I quite agree.

103
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.700
Here. A toast to you.

104
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.260
Miss Nie, I wish you

105
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.580
a speedy success.

106
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.660
Thanks.

107
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.460
What the heck!

108
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:27.820
What a day...

109
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.460
What are you doing here again?

110
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.460
You think I wanted to come?

111
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.580
Perfect timing.

112
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.700
I was just going to see you.

113
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.700
See me?

114
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.460
What for?

115
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.260
Look what you've done.

116
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:40.780
Overnight,

117
00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.900
you silenced all scholars in town.

118
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:42.980
Aren't you telling everyone

119
00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:44.780
that I'm indeed
the No.1 She-devil? Idiot!

120
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:46.700
Come on.

121
00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.460
Last night, I did ask Gui Bai

122
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.700
to take his men to...

123
00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.340
Yeah.

124
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.780
To visit the scholars.

125
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.820
But they also confessed

126
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:56.540
how they slandered you.

127
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:57.260
Gui Bai even found

128
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.900
evidence of the rumors.

129
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.140
I compiled the evidence the whole night

130
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.460
and tomorrow, I'll submit it.

131
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.100
Time for local priggish scholars

132
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:06.900
to stop making trouble.

133
00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.540
Then how did they become dumb?

134
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.700
They did too many bad things.

135
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:16.580
As they confessed,

136
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.340
they kept prattling and prattling

137
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.780
until they talked themselves hoarse.

138
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:23.700
Oh, really?

139
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.260
You made some sacrifices.

140
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:31.780
But people in town would no longer

141
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:33.580
be disturbed by these priggish scholars.

142
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.100
Such sacrifices are worth your while.

143
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.580
Idiot.

144
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.860
Don't think I'll be grateful

145
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.100
for what you've done.

146
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.300
Who cares?

147
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:48.500
Sadly, Ling Jianxing

148
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:49.700
got off.

149
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:51.980
What do you mean?

150
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.580
Yesterday, those priggish scholars

151
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.220
identified Ling Jianxing.

152
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:56.580
However,

153
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.220
someone came forward,

154
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.700
saying he made a big thing out of it

155
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.060
in Ling Jianxing's name.

156
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.340
Another scapegoat!

157
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:05.820
Darn it, Ling Jianxing.

158
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:06.500
That's all right.

159
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.740
I'll try to force him out

160
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:09.740
in a day or two.

161
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.700
I won't let anyone who hurt you

162
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:12.740
get off scot-free.

163
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.500
Exactly.

164
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:26.700
You...

165
00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:28.980
Why are you caring

166
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.820
so much about my problem?

167
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.740
Because you're...

168
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.700
A titled lady.

169
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.100
No one can frame you.

170
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:44.180
Oh, I see.

171
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.980
You wouldn't like me, would you?

172
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:50.500
I like you?

173
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.220
Don't be kidding.

174
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.340
By the way,

175
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.060
I have something to ask you.

176
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.580
Where did you go this afternoon?

177
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.860
None of your business.

178
00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.700
I went shopping.

179
00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:07.940
Didn't you say

180
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.220
the rumors stopped you from going out?

181
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.060
Then what did you go out for?

182
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.860
Must I tell you where I go?

183
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.300
You...

184
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.220
- Why can you...
- Your Lordship.

185
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:19.700
Officials from the Court
of Judicial Review

186
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.100
broke in with a token.

187
00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:22.620
I didn't dare to stop them.

188
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.980
Court of Judicial Review?

189
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:27.740
Have they already known

190
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:28.340
what happened

191
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.060
to those priggish scholars?

192
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:29.980
So fast?

193
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.580
I don't think they came for you.

194
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.220
They came for me, I guess.

195
00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:36.820
You?

196
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.180
(Feiwan Pavilion)

197
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:49.820
Your Lordship,

198
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.980
last night in the suburban
Temple of Earth,

199
00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.580
several beggars died distressingly.

200
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:54.740
A woman and her son

201
00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.580
had something to do with you.

202
00:10:57.820 --> 00:10:58.820
Now, we believe

203
00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.580
you're involved in this case.

204
00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:03.420
Please go with us.

205
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.220
It can't be true.

206
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.100
Last night,

207
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.340
he was compiling the evidence

208
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:06.980
about how priggish scholars framed me.

209
00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.560
How could he be involved

210
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:08.500
in a murder case?

211
00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:09.700
Your Ladyship,

212
00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.460
were you with His Lordship last night?

213
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:13.460
No.

214
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.820
Was anyone else with you, Your Lordship?

215
00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.220
No.

216
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.980
Then sorry,

217
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.220
but you have to go with us.

218
00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:23.910
But...

219
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.700
You're just doing your job

220
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.500
and I won't hold you up.

221
00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.100
I'll go with you.

222
00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.100
Thank you, Your Lordship.

223
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.220
This way, please.

224
00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.420
Go check the temple.

225
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:37.980
Be very careful, Your Lordship.

226
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.220
Ning Yuxuan!

227
00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.460
Don't worry, Sangyu.

228
00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.700
You naughty villain, stay safe.

229
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.980
I'll be all right.

230
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:54.820
Here we go.

231
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:02.220
How can Ning Yuxuan

232
00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.580
be involved in a murder case?

233
00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:06.420
What on earth happened?

234
00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:32.820
Who sent you?

235
00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:02.180
When you talked about the assassins,

236
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.700
you reminded me of something.

237
00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.340
I'm all ears.

238
00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.820
A couple of years ago,

239
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.220
I met a man

240
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.740
Huang Han

241
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.100
from the Tea Gang.

242
00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.940
He told me

243
00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.300
many of his surviving buddies

244
00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.180
followed another man

245
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.220
from their gang

246
00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:23.700
to Haifang.

247
00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:27.100
Haifang?

248
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.100
Do you know who they followed?

249
00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.820
He didn't tell me that.

250
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.460
I just know

251
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.940
that man used to be a nobody

252
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:36.620
in the Tea Gang.

253
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.100
But for no reason,

254
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.100
he made a fortune

255
00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.340
and recruited many of his old buddies.

256
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.860
In the temple,

257
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.340
those assassins wore rattan shoes

258
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:48.220
that actually belonged to boatmen.

259
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.220
Miss Wen?

260
00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.340
Your Ladyship.

261
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.620
What's wrong?

262
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.220
Your Ladyship,

263
00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.940
when can His Lordship come back?

264
00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.100
Don't worry too much,

265
00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.580
in case you get sick.

266
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.580
Take good care of yourself.

267
00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.860
Thank you for your concern. I get it.

268
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.460
I'll leave you alone.

269
00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.340
Your Ladyship,

270
00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.860
how about you cry a little bit, too?

271
00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.460
If people know you don't cry,

272
00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.170
will they portray you again

273
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:31.230
as the No.1 She-devil of the Capital

274
00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.450
with a heart of stone?

275
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:34.460
It's not time

276
00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.460
to worry about this.

277
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:38.300
I wonder

278
00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.700
how Ning Yuxuan is doing now.

279
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:40.580
Your Ladyship.

280
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.420
Gui Bai?

281
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:43.220
Your Ladyship.

282
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.220
Gui Bai, what have you got?

283
00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:45.220
Any clues?

284
00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.300
I've got something urgent to report.

285
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:47.460
I have to see His Lordship.

286
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.340
Wait.

287
00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:49.220
He's in prison.

288
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:50.060
How can you see him now?

289
00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.180
There's no time to lose.

290
00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.740
I would even try to break in.

291
00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.580
Gui Bai!

292
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:54.980
The prison is heavily guarded.

293
00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.700
Strong martial arts alone

294
00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.700
can't get you in.

295
00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.860
We must think of a plan.

296
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.940
How can we visit him?

297
00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.500
I've got an idea.

298
00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:29.580
(Prison of the Censorate)

299
00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:34.700
Who are you?

300
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.500
I'm Marquis Moyu's wife.

301
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.500
I want to see my husband.

302
00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.740
He's a felon

303
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.820
and he can see no visitors.

304
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:40.580
Nonsense!

305
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:41.980
He isn't convicted yet.

306
00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:42.940
Besides,

307
00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.460
I'm not a mere visitor.

308
00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:48.740
My father is Nie Xiangyuan,

309
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.220
General Zhenyuan.

310
00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.460
And I'm...

311
00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.340
I'm...

312
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:04.620
Muxu.

313
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:06.860
Muxu.

314
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.860
Yes, Your Ladyship.

315
00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:14.620
I'm a second-rank lady

316
00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:15.420
with imperial mandate.

317
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.260
See?

318
00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.420
This isn't fake.

319
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:19.980
But...

320
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:20.780
Your Ladyship,

321
00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.020
please don't embarrass us.

322
00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.300
The Minister ordered

323
00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.060
no one should approach His Lordship.

324
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.300
Officer,

325
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.860
let me tell you the truth.

326
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.180
My husband was arrested

327
00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.780
all... all of a sudden.

328
00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:37.940
He didn't leave any instructions.

329
00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:39.780
My family is now in a mess.

330
00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.180
Take this.

331
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:47.380
Your Ladyship...

332
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.260
You have to take this.

333
00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:49.020
But Your Ladyship...

334
00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.220
- Take this.
- Your Ladyship...

335
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.020
Just take this.

336
00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:51.460
But...

337
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.860
You're working very hard.

338
00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:55.260
I,

339
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.300
as a titled lady,

340
00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.380
promise you this.

341
00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:58.860
I'll come out immediately

342
00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:59.740
after giving him something.

343
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.980
Please make an exception.

344
00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:06.740
Open the door.

345
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:10.700
Go.

346
00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:24.180
Ning Yuxuan.

347
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.460
What are you doing here?

348
00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:28.620
I...

349
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.380
You think I wanted to visit you?

350
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.220
Gui Bai has something to tell you.

351
00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.020
Your Lordship, I checked the temple.

352
00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.140
What have you got?

353
00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:49.700
There,

354
00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.220
I only found these two things.

355
00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.380
There were signs of a struggle.

356
00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:08.220
Sangyu, this case...

357
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:11.660
Not interested.

358
00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:14.460
I...

359
00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:18.940
Go on.

360
00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:21.940
There were signs of a struggle.

361
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.980
Between two groups, I think.

362
00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.980
Some were martial artists.

363
00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.060
And the others

364
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.500
wore light shoes.

365
00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.940
It's a boatmen's shoe.

366
00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:33.180
The Tea Gang?

367
00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:35.460
I thought

368
00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.740
Ling Jianxing killed the beggars

369
00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.140
and framed me.

370
00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.140
But now,

371
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.500
the man named Lang

372
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.020
might also be involved.

373
00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.460
I'm confused, too.

374
00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.380
Did they

375
00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.620
collude with each other?

376
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.220
Is it possible

377
00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.860
that the Tea Gang I've been investigating

378
00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.660
skulks in Haifang?

379
00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.260
I think I have to go there.

380
00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:57.900
But Your Lordship,

381
00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.020
you're now in prison.

382
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.180
How can you get yourself out?

383
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:02.980
Before annihilating the Tea Gang,

384
00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.380
the world couldn't enjoy any peace.

385
00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:06.460
But whether

386
00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.060
they've colluded with Ling Jianxing

387
00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:09.980
needs to be verified.

388
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.740
Go back with my wife first.

389
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.980
This seems to be a crisis

390
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.460
but may also be a turning point.

391
00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:18.940
Yes.

392
00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.380
Take care, Your Lordship.

393
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.260
You know how to get out?

394
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.260
Not yet.

395
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.060
Then how can it be a turning point?

396
00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.260
Is everything all right at home?

397
00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.180
Yes.

398
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:34.980
When I'm there, nothing can go wrong.

399
00:20:35.940 --> 00:20:36.460
Let's go.

400
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:44.980
Umm...

401
00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.300
Don't you have anything

402
00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.620
to tell me?

403
00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:06.220
I heard food here was very poor.

404
00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.220
This is the snack box

405
00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.220
I always carry.

406
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:13.420
You keep it.

407
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:16.620
What?

408
00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.460
Don't you want to check what's in it?

409
00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.140
No.

410
00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:22.740
Thank you.

411
00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:28.780
Listen.

412
00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.420
I brought Gui Bai to you.

413
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.380
You owe me one bead.

414
00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.700
And I gave you my snack box.

415
00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.740
You owe me another.

416
00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.860
Two beads.

417
00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:35.700
Give them to me when you return home.

418
00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.380
Time's up. You should go.

419
00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.140
Don't go back on your word.

420
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.140
Do you hear?

421
00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.220
Wait.

422
00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:11.700
Two refugees were killed

423
00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.860
and Ning Yuxuan was framed.

424
00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:13.980
So, he was wounded

425
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:15.140
because those refugees fought him,

426
00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:15.700
right?

427
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.660
I'm asking you. Am I right?

428
00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:24.140
If you don't reply,

429
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:26.220
I'll have all our maids

430
00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:28.500
see how you're dressed now.

431
00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:32.540
Confess.

432
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:39.380
Just tell me.

433
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:40.220
Otherwise,

434
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:40.860
how could we

435
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.300
work together to help my husband?

436
00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:47.980
You're right, Your Ladyship.

437
00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.260
His Lordship was stabbed by a refugee

438
00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.860
when investigating the bandits.

439
00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.620
But instead of punishing them,

440
00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:56.940
His Lordship asked me

441
00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:58.220
to give them some help.

442
00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.460
Then why did they

443
00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.260
assassinate Ning Yuxuan?

444
00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:06.460
Oh, I see.

445
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.860
Over all these years,

446
00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:11.300
he's been hunting the Tea Gang.

447
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:12.900
Sometimes, innocent people were hurt.

448
00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:13.500
So, these refugees

449
00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.780
are very likely to be

450
00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.140
innocent families of the Tea Gang

451
00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.620
who always hate Ning Yuxuan.

452
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:23.180
Well, they're really pathetic.

453
00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:24.980
They got homeless already.

454
00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:25.980
And now, they're involved

455
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.740
in the political struggle

456
00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:28.180
and have even lost their lives.

457
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.220
But Ning Yuxuan is

458
00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.980
quite a good official.

459
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:37.940
Have you heard?

460
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:38.900
Left Consul Ning Yuxuan

461
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:39.740
killed some people in the temple.

462
00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:40.460
I heard about it.

463
00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.780
Everyone's talking about that.

464
00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.460
The devil couple caused trouble.

465
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.460
In the temple,

466
00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.020
Marquis Moyu killed all the refugees.

467
00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:47.660
Horrible!

468
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.460
How come?

469
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:49.980
How could he possibly kill anyone?

470
00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:50.660
That's true.

471
00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:51.980
It has got about in town.

472
00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:52.980
I heard about that, too.

473
00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.180
He even killed

474
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:55.140
old people and kids.

475
00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:56.460
No way.

476
00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.940
That's true. You know what?

477
00:23:58.020 --> 00:23:59.460
Everyone's talking about it.

478
00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:00.220
The whole town knew it.

479
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:02.260
That was absolutely tragic.

480
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.300
The devil couple massacred people.

481
00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.700
Behind them,

482
00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.260
there must be a horrible scheme.

483
00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.660
Who's slandering my sister
and her husband?

484
00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.260
Come out!

485
00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:15.460
Is it you?

486
00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.460
- No, no.
- No.

487
00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:19.180
And you?

488
00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:20.740
No, no.

489
00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.220
It must be you, then!

490
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.460
Umm...

491
00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.500
Miss,

492
00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:26.260
those guys

493
00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.700
who gossiped about Marquis Moyu

494
00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.020
have gone.

495
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:29.980
It... It...

496
00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.700
It has nothing to do with us.

497
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.940
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

498
00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:33.620
We're innocent.

499
00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:34.260
My Lady,

500
00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:35.940
how about we go home?

501
00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:36.980
Don't be afraid.

502
00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:39.420
Whoever comes today,

503
00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:41.220
I have to give them a lesson!

504
00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.300
Who do you mean?

505
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.180
So, you're the troublemaker?

506
00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.740
Mr. Tao.

507
00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:08.220
You are... Qingyun?

508
00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.460
Yes!

509
00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.180
Qingyun, long time no see.

510
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:15.500
Yeah.

511
00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.380
It's been a long time.

512
00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:18.980
We haven't met for years.

513
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.420
When you left the capital,

514
00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:21.460
you were a little girl.

515
00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:23.180
But now, you've grown up.

516
00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:27.380
Mr. Tao,

517
00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.740
you look as valiant

518
00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.460
as before.

519
00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:33.740
Oh,

520
00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:34.780
did you come here

521
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:35.660
for my brother-in-law's case?

522
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:37.780
Yes. I was patrolling nearby.

523
00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:39.540
Hearing someone was staring rumors,

524
00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:40.700
I rushed over.

525
00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:42.660
Those rumormongers

526
00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:44.060
never do anything right!

527
00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.860
If I catch them,

528
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.420
I will...

529
00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.380
I'll deal with them later.

530
00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:58.740
Such rumormongers

531
00:25:58.900 --> 00:25:59.460
not only slandered me,

532
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:00.140
but even

533
00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:01.420
bullied Ning Yuxuan!

534
00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:02.180
Yeah!

535
00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:05.620
Tell me.

536
00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:07.180
Has Ning Yuxuan

537
00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.540
always been as cold-blooded

538
00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.500
as people say?

539
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.260
Yes.

540
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.260
Why?

541
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.020
Your Ladyship.

542
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:18.860
What's wrong, Nanny Liu?

543
00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:19.740
Your Ladyship.

544
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.660
Come on. Be seated.

545
00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.460
- Your Ladyship.
- What's wrong?

546
00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:26.220
Please don't trust

547
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.220
those rumors.

548
00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.620
In no case can His Lordship

549
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.020
be a merciless murderer.

550
00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.500
After he was born,

551
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.500
His Lordship grew up in this house.

552
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:40.670
Back then,

553
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.180
he was cute and lively.

554
00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:44.940
He gave lovely names

555
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.620
to little pets

556
00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:48.740
and even plants here.

557
00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:50.660
He also regarded servants like us

558
00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.220
as his own family.

559
00:26:57.220 --> 00:26:58.460
But then,

560
00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.940
his father died.

561
00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.700
His Lordship was badly upset.

562
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.980
He locked himself in his room

563
00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.740
and didn't come out for days.

564
00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.220
When he finally came out,

565
00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:14.500
he couldn't even say a single word.

566
00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.020
Seriously?

567
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:20.460
He didn't restart

568
00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.380
to talk

569
00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:25.300
until more than a year later.

570
00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:26.980
But shortly after that,

571
00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.180
his mother passed away, too.

572
00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.060
That was the last time

573
00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:37.060
I had seen His Lordship shed tears.

574
00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.500
Over all these years,

575
00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:46.140
however badly

576
00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.980
he was wronged,

577
00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:50.020
he's never explained.

578
00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:50.900
And

579
00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.460
however happy he was,

580
00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.220
he's never laughed out, either.

581
00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.740
Every time I see him remain indifferent,

582
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.500
my heart aches.

583
00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:08.300
Your Ladyship,

584
00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:11.540
after you woke up
from falling off the cliff,

585
00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:13.220
His Lordship

586
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:15.220
started to smile.

587
00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:16.540
It made me

588
00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:18.020
so happy.

589
00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.220
I thought

590
00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.700
His Lordship would live a sweet life.

591
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:23.700
But unexpectedly...

592
00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:24.660
Unexpectedly,

593
00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.460
he was even arrested.

594
00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.940
Before,

595
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:34.500
I really knew

596
00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:36.500
very little about him.

597
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.180
So, in his childhood,

598
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:42.300
he went through so many misfortunes.

599
00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.060
Nanny Liu, stop worrying.

600
00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:53.180
We will find a way

601
00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.260
to get him out.

602
00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.380
You have to help him.

603
00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.220
I'll let go of what you did before.

604
00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.300
But today,

605
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.980
you have to do this for me.

606
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:19.700
Here, 200 taels of silver.

607
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:20.460
Her Ladyship

608
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.060
wants you to write some essays

609
00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.540
to vindicate His Lordship

610
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:24.980
and publicize the philanthropic deeds

611
00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.500
he has been doing.

612
00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.460
Well...

613
00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.500
It's a tough job.

614
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.460
After all, everyone in town is

615
00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.260
talking about this murder case.

616
00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.460
But Your Ladyship,

617
00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.700
if you offer more money, I...

618
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:46.940
Got it.

619
00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:53.540
50 taels off.

620
00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:54.700
Your Ladyship, you...

621
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:55.420
Do you take this job?

622
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.540
But you're doing this wrong.

623
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.620
Like you said,

624
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:01.940
everyone in town is

625
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.180
talking about Ning Yuxuan's case.

626
00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:04.860
A lot of scholars are waiting

627
00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:05.940
to take this job.

628
00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.740
If you reject it, many others want it.

629
00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:10.180
I mean...

630
00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:18.220
Another 50 taels off.

631
00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:27.700
Deal.

632
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:31.300
The ninth thing.

633
00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:32.220
Ning Yuxuan

634
00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:32.900
usually pulls

635
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:33.940
a long face.

636
00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:34.740
However,

637
00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:36.620
he does good deeds all the time.

638
00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:37.300
For example,

639
00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.060
the flood in the Southeast
in recent years...

640
00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.660
Thanks to his repeated report,

641
00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:41.460
it was finally

642
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:42.260
effectively controlled.

643
00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:43.180
The tenth thing.

644
00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:44.900
Every year, he goes to disaster areas

645
00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.380
to help victims and give out food.

646
00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.620
He offers aid

647
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.380
to everyone in need.

648
00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:49.700
The eleventh thing...

649
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.340
(The eleventh...)

650
00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.260
Enough, isn't it?

651
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:01.660
So much for this.

652
00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.780
I heard Mr. Wang of the Ministry of War

653
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:05.260
would hold a banquet

654
00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.740
in Kuixing Restaurant tonight.

655
00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:07.780
You must hurry.

656
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.220
Tonight, go spread

657
00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.180
all these stories

658
00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.140
in Kuixing Restaurant.

659
00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:15.300
If you do this job

660
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.220
very well...

661
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.220
Got it?

662
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.740
You'll be satisfied, Your Ladyship.

663
00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.260
Your Ladyship,

664
00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:29.260
His Lordship is still in prison.

665
00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:30.420
What...

666
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.180
What are we doing here?

667
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.700
These days,

668
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:35.900
some civilians in the capital

669
00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.460
want to pray for His Lordship.

670
00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.020
After we set the table here,

671
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.780
they will light incense for Ning Yuxuan.

672
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.260
We'll make his good reputation

673
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.260
reach His Majesty's ears.

674
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:49.940
Yes.

675
00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.860
(Marquis Ning Yuxuan works hard
and loves his people.)

676
00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.020
Muxu, tomorrow,

677
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.980
ask our purchasers

678
00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.700
to communicate more

679
00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:56.700
with purchasing eunuchs

680
00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:57.590
from the Palace

681
00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:58.260
and tell them

682
00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.460
how aggrieved Ning Yuxuan is.

683
00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:00.620
Yes, Your Ladyship.

684
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.940
You care so much about His Lordship.

685
00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:06.740
But after doing so many things,

686
00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:07.700
we've nearly used up

687
00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:09.700
all our money.

688
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.500
Anyway,

689
00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.620
Ning Yuxuan is bad-tempered.

690
00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:18.980
But after all,

691
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.420
he's an incorruptible official.

692
00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:24.020
I don't want villains to take office.

693
00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.860
Marquis Moyu, we trust you.

694
00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:32.460
Hope you'll get out of trouble.

695
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.060
Marquis Moyu,

696
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.420
we believe you're framed.

697
00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:37.700
Hope you can

698
00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.700
be released soon

699
00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:39.900
and then defend us.

700
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:45.180
Hope Marquis Moyu can be vindicated soon!

701
00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.580
(Prison of the Censorate)

702
00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:53.900
(Marquis Ning Yuxuan works hard
and loves his people.)

703
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:58.060
(To frame me,)

704
00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.380
(you murdered innocent refugees.)

705
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.540
(You Tea Gang villains)

706
00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:04.460
(deserve to be killed!)

707
00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:24.220
Mr. Cao.

708
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.220
Left Consul,

709
00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:33.300
I've been receiving reports,

710
00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.220
urging me to severely punish you!

711
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.540
In private,

712
00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:43.740
you killed those bandits.

713
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.380
You think I'm not aware?

714
00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.140
I was just turning

715
00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.220
a blind eye!

716
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.940
Do you still not repent?

717
00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:52.740
Your Majesty,

718
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:55.900
I always remember
how my father was killed.

719
00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.060
But I've never killed anyone innocent.

720
00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.180
Left Consul,

721
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:04.700
you are lucky

722
00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.700
to have a good wife.

723
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:07.350
Now, the entire capital city

724
00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:08.740
knows that the Ning family

725
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:10.100
has been loyal for generations,

726
00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.180
and that Marquis Moyu was framed.

727
00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.100
Those petitioners who support you

728
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:16.420
are swarming

729
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:17.420
outside the gate of my palace.

730
00:34:17.460 --> 00:34:18.420
I apologize, Your Majesty!

731
00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.300
I have a playful wife.

732
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:21.740
I assure you

733
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.100
that she shall be disciplined.

734
00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:38.980
I've finished reading

735
00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.380
your reports.

736
00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:41.580
Wang Ning.

737
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.300
Your Majesty,

738
00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.180
the case

739
00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:46.820
where Marquis Moyu killed beggars

740
00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.980
was tried by three divisions yesterday.

741
00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.620
Based on comments of the Censorate

742
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.940
and the Ministry of Justice,

743
00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.060
the Court of Judicial Review decided
to clear Marquis Moyu's name

744
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:55.660
and he would be acquitted.

745
00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:56.500
What?

746
00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.020
Acquitted?

747
00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:01.820
How ridiculous!

748
00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.020
Cold and hungry refugees

749
00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:04.860
took shelter in the temple.

750
00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:05.900
That was already bad.

751
00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.540
But our consul

752
00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.100
killed them for fun.

753
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.260
Without proper judgment,

754
00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.660
what would all nations

755
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.900
think of me?

756
00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:14.780
Your Majesty,

757
00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:18.340
the murder case has proved inconclusive.

758
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.500
The evidence from the Ministry of Justice

759
00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.420
remains doubtful.

760
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.340
This has really been

761
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:22.620
the worst case ever.

762
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:23.860
If Marquis Moyu is severely punished now

763
00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:24.780
but proves to be innocent

764
00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:26.620
after the truth is found out,

765
00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:27.580
I'm afraid

766
00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:30.100
our nation would be disgraced.

767
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.500
The truth isn't important now.

768
00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:38.300
Ning Yuxuan must be severely punished!

769
00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.140
I reviewed the written judgments

770
00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.060
of the Ministry of Justice

771
00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.060
and the Censorate.

772
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:43.500
Exiling him to a state

773
00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:45.580
isn't severe enough.

774
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.140
But due to ancestral rules,

775
00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:53.100
I can't kill him.

776
00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:55.900
But General,

777
00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:57.500
Yuxuan is innocent.

778
00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.380
Listen.

779
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.500
Criminal Ning Yuxuan

780
00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.740
misbehaved

781
00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:09.100
and committed crimes.

782
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.300
He's deprived of his title of nobility,

783
00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.980
deposed as the assistant administrator,

784
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.100
and will be exiled.

785
00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:18.900
Let him be...

786
00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.260
The magistrate of Haifang.

787
00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:27.420
Haifang?

788
00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:30.580
He has to reflect on himself!

789
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:33.140
The court is done.

790
00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.180
Your Highness.

791
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:49.940
Your Highness.

792
00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:52.980
The court is done?

793
00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:55.860
What was the judgment?

794
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.060
His Majesty was furious.

795
00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.660
Ning Yuxuan totally fell into disgrace.

796
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:02.980
The final judgment is

797
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.620
exile him to Haifang.

798
00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:08.980
Tell me.

799
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:11.860
Why did His Majesty

800
00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:13.580
exile him to Haifang?

801
00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:17.980
For punishment

802
00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.340
or for some other plans?

803
00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:21.860
Can't you even see that?

804
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.460
Don't worry.

805
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.460
I won't let Ning Yuxuan

806
00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:28.540
get into Haifang!

807
00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.420
Hold the cup.

808
00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:01.460
After a long time,

809
00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.620
the tea would be tasteless.

810
00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.940
Time to make some new tea.

811
00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.180
I will

812
00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.140
accomplish my mission.

813
00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.100
Your Ladyship!

814
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.300
Muxu.

815
00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.100
What? Any news?

816
00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:24.660
According to Gui Bai,

817
00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.180
His Lordship was convicted by His Majesty

818
00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.140
and would be exiled to Haifang.

819
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.100
Exiled?

820
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.140
Good.

821
00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:36.940
He can be alive, at least.

822
00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:40.460
Haifang.

823
00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.620
Haifang.

824
00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.660
What is that place?

825
00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:44.740
Haifang...

826
00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:46.580
That's a mysterious place.

827
00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.500
Some say

828
00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:49.020
people there are rather tough.

829
00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:49.580
Some others say

830
00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.020
people there are very simple.

831
00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:51.980
Someone says

832
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:52.580
it's a town

833
00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.180
full of strange things.

834
00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.500
What's worse,

835
00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.140
someone says it's a town of pirates

836
00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.140
where no one can survive.

837
00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.460
So, I'm worried

838
00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.540
if His Lordship

839
00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.940
can return safely from this trip.

840
00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.180
In this case,

841
00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:08.140
I bet His Majesty
sends Ning Yuxuan to Haifang

842
00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.500
because he's after something else.
